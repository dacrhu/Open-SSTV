"""Tests for the text-overlay renderer.

v0.1.32 regression guards for the Exchange-template-on-narrow-frames
bug: the bottom overlay ``UR {rst} {date}`` at 20 pt used to render
wider than the frame, and the centring math in ``position_to_xy``
produced a negative ``x`` that spilled text off the right edge of the
transmitted image.

The 160 × 128 canvas used below is a deliberately undersized synthetic
frame, not a mode we ship — the narrowest real mode is 320 px.  (It was
written when M2 / M4 / S2 / S4 were wrongly held to be 160 px wide; see
issue #65.)  Keeping it undersized is the point: it holds the auto-fit
path under more pressure than any real transmission applies.

The fix is twofold:

* ``draw_text_overlay`` auto-shrinks the font size (one point at a
  time) until the text fits within ``image_width − 2 × _MARGIN``, down
  to ``_MIN_FONT_SIZE``.
* A new ``clamp_xy_to_image`` clamps the final ``(x, y)`` so the 1 px
  drop-shadow ring always stays on-image.

These tests exercise both mechanisms.
