    ``TypeError`` at write time.  ``AppConfig`` today is all primitive
    scalars and strings, but a future field with type ``pathlib.Path``

    of ``str``) or ``enum.Enum`` (e.g. ``default_tx_mode`` as ``Mode``
    instead of ``str``) would crash save_config the first time a user
    saved their Settings.

        non-string key would still raise at write time, but that's
        a schema bug)
      * everything else passed through unchanged
