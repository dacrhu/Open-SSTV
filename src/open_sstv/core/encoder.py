"""SSTV encoder — thin facade over PySSTV.

PySSTV (MIT) already implements the encoder for every mode we care about
*except* Robot 36, whose upstream class emits a "single-line" format that
virtually no real-world decoder can understand. This module patches that
one mode with ``Robot36LinePair``, a subclass that emits the canonical
line-pair format used by MMSSTV, SimpleSSTV (iOS), and over-the-air
transmissions — where one sync pulse covers two image rows.

For all other modes, the PySSTV class is used as-is. This module exists
so the rest of the app never imports ``pysstv`` directly: it gives us one
place to (a) translate from our ``Mode`` enum to PySSTV's class objects,
(b) preprocess images (resize to mode-native dimensions, convert to RGB)
before handing them off, and (c) return a single NumPy array for the
audio output layer instead of PySSTV's per-sample generator.

PySSTV does **not** auto-resize input images — it calls ``image.getpixel``
at integer coordinates up to ``WIDTH × HEIGHT`` and crashes (or wraps) if
the image is the wrong size. The facade resizes with Pillow LANCZOS so
callers can pass any image and trust it'll come out at the mode's native
resolution. We also normalize to ``RGB`` so palette / RGBA / grayscale
inputs all work without surprising the encoder.

    """Robot 36 encoder that emits the canonical *line-pair* format.

    PySSTV's ``Robot36`` produces a single-line format (one sync per image
    row, alternating Cr / Cb on consecutive lines). Real-world decoders —
    MMSSTV, SimpleSSTV iOS, slowrx, QSSTV — expect the ITU line-pair
    layout where one sync pulse covers *two* image rows.

    Super-line layout (300 ms, 120 total for a 320×240 image)::

        ── even half (150 ms) ──
        SYNC          9.0 ms  @ 1200 Hz
        SYNC PORCH    3.0 ms  @ 1500 Hz
        Y_even       88.0 ms  (320 pixels, luminance of even row)
        EVEN SEP      4.5 ms  @ 1500 Hz
        COLOR PORCH   1.5 ms  @ 1900 Hz
        Cr           44.0 ms  (320 pixels, averaged from even + odd rows)
        ── odd half (150 ms) ──
        SYNC          9.0 ms  @ 1200 Hz
        SYNC PORCH    3.0 ms  @ 1500 Hz
        Y_odd        88.0 ms  (320 pixels, luminance of odd row)
        ODD SEP       4.5 ms  @ 2300 Hz
        COLOR PORCH   1.5 ms  @ 1900 Hz
        Cb           44.0 ms  (320 pixels, averaged from even + odd rows)

    Each half is a complete 150 ms line with its own sync pulse — decoders
    like MMSSTV and slowrx detect the 1200 Hz sync at the start of *each*
    half to stay locked. Total: 2 × 150 ms × 120 pairs = 36 000 ms = 36 s
    (matching the mode name).

    Chroma is averaged between the two rows in each pair, which is what
    every reference decoder assumes (the 4:2:0-ish subsampling inherent
    in Robot 36's design).

# Corrected upstream widths: Martin M2 and Scottie S2
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PySSTV ships ``MartinM2.WIDTH = 160`` and ``ScottieS2.WIDTH = 160``, which
# misreads the protocol.  M2 and S2 halve the *pixel dwell time*, not the
# pixel count: M2 is 320 px × 0.2288 ms = 73.216 ms per channel against M1's
# 320 × 0.4576 ms, and S2 is 320 × 0.2752 ms = 88.064 ms against S1's
# 320 × 0.4320 ms.  Both are narrower-bandwidth versions of the same 320×256
# frame, which is why every published mode table and every other decoder
# (slowrx ``modespec.c``, QSSTV, MMSSTV) lists them as 320×256.
#
# ``SCAN`` is deliberately left alone — the line timing upstream produces is
# correct, and PySSTV derives ``msec_pixel = SCAN / WIDTH``, so widening
# WIDTH halves the dwell time and leaves the on-air line period identical.
# The audio is bit-compatible in length with what we shipped before; what
# changes is that the 320 columns now carry 320 distinct values instead of
# 160 duplicated pairs, and we stop squeezing the operator's landscape
# picture into a 160×256 portrait first (issue #65).
