"""FM demodulation primitives.

SSTV is FM-modulated audio: sync at 1200 Hz, color tones spanning 1500 Hz
(black) to 2300 Hz (white). This module owns the conversion from raw audio
samples to an instantaneous-frequency track and from frequencies to luma.

The decoder pipeline is::

    samples (float32, mono)
        ──> analytic_signal      # complex baseband via Hilbert
        ──> instantaneous_frequency  # one Hz value per sample
        ──> freq_to_luma         # one 0..255 byte per sample

Slicing the resulting luma stream into pixels is the per-mode decoder's job
(``core/decoder.py``); this module just hands back a frequency / luma track.

Constants
---------
SSTV_BLACK_HZ, SSTV_WHITE_HZ:
    Color-tone endpoints. The 1500 / 2300 Hz convention is the same across
    every Martin / Scottie / Robot / PD mode we ship in v1.
SSTV_SYNC_HZ:
    1200 Hz horizontal sync tone. The sync detector lives in ``core/sync.py``
    and uses this constant rather than re-defining it.

Public API
----------
analytic_signal(x) -> np.ndarray[complex]
    Hilbert transform of a real-valued buffer.

instantaneous_frequency(x, fs) -> np.ndarray[float64]
    Per-sample instantaneous frequency in Hz. Output length matches input
    length (the phase-difference is right-padded by one sample so callers
    don't have to special-case off-by-one indexing).

freq_to_luma(freq_hz) -> np.ndarray[uint8] | int
    Linear map of 1500..2300 Hz to 0..255 byte luma, clipped at the
    endpoints. Accepts a scalar (returns int) or an array (returns uint8).
