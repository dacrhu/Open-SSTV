"""Per-line streaming SSTV decoder — covers every mode in the app (default).

Enabled by default via ``AppConfig.incremental_decode = True``
(set to False to fall back to the legacy batch decoder).

Problem solved
--------------
The batch ``Decoder`` reprocesses the full growing audio buffer on every
flush: O(buffer²) total CPU.  For a 110-second Scottie S1 receive that
means ~18 flushes × average buffer of ~55 s ≈ 990 equivalent full-signal
passes.  For Martin M1 (~114 s) the same pattern meant the batch path was
falling behind real-time partway through the image on laptop-class
hardware.  This module replaces that with O(1 line period) per feed call —
a ~50× improvement on long modes and, for Martin M1, the difference
between "fine" and "slideshow".

Architecture
------------
``IncrementalDecoderBase`` owns the common machinery: a bounded sliding
audio window, sync-candidate harvesting with ``walk_sync_grid``, per-line
window extraction with ``FILTER_MARGIN`` samples of sosfiltfilt padding,
and audio pruning down to the next expected line's leading edge.

Concrete backends cover every pixel-RGB and YCbCr mode we ship:

* ``ScottieIncrementalDecoder`` — ``BEFORE_RED`` Scottie family
  (S1 / S2 / DX / S3 / S4).  Sync lands mid-line; G and B offsets are
  negative relative to the sync pulse.
* ``MartinIncrementalDecoder`` — ``LINE_START`` Martin family
  (M1 / M2 / M3 / M4).  One sync + four porches + three equal GBR scans.
* ``PDIncrementalDecoder`` — ``LINE_START`` PD family
  (PD-50 / 90 / 120 / 160 / 180 / 240 / 290).  One sync + one porch +
  four equal scans (Y0 / Cr / Cb / Y1); each sync produces **two**
  output image rows.  YCbCr→RGB is done per-pair to match PIL's
  ``Image.frombytes("YCbCr", ...).convert("RGB")`` path exactly.
* ``WraaseIncrementalDecoder`` — ``LINE_START`` Wraase SC2 family
  (SC2-120 / SC2-180).  One sync + one porch + three back-to-back RGB
  scans (no inter-channel gaps).
* ``PasokonIncrementalDecoder`` — ``LINE_START`` Pasokon family
  (P3 / P5 / P7).  One sync + four equal gaps + three RGB scans.
* ``Robot36IncrementalDecoder`` — auto-detecting wrapper that buffers
  the first ~450–900 ms of post-VIS audio, measures inter-sync spacing,
  and dispatches to the per-line or line-pair backend as appropriate.
  The backends are a Python port of the slowrx decoder (windytan/slowrx,
  GPL): single-sample-with-small-mean per pixel, nearest-neighbour
  chroma row copy, and slowrx's integer YCbCr→RGB matrix.  This is
  deliberately different from the windowed-median + PIL pipeline that
  every other mode uses — Robot 36's chroma channel is short, sync-
  adjacent, and was producing edge artefacts through that pipeline; the
  slowrx port is known-good against real-world HF transmissions.

Byte-identical guarantee
------------------------
With ``FILTER_MARGIN = 4096`` samples of sosfiltfilt padding before and
after each pixel region, the windowed filtered signal is numerically
identical to what the batch decoder produces on the full signal.  The
order-4 Butterworth impulse response decays to <1e-10 within ~200
samples; 4096 is massive overkill that guarantees byte-identical output
even at the very first line.  See ``test_incremental_decoder.py``.

NOTE: ``_sample_pixels_inc`` below is intentionally kept (mostly) in
sync with ``decoder._sample_pixels``.  It diverges on the chroma floor
and right-edge guard (see the function's docstring); Robot 36 does not
use this helper at all — it has its own slowrx-style sampler.

       but sync-pulse leakage (~1200 Hz) clamps to neutral instead of

       10-15 samples into the end of the chroma scan; those windows are

# Robot 36 — ported from slowrx (windytan/slowrx, GPL)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Implementation follows the slowrx reference decoder's approach instead
# of the shared ``_sample_pixels_inc`` / PIL machinery used by other
# modes.  The previous attempt at Robot 36 inherited the batch decoder's
# windowed-median sampler and a PIL ``YCbCr → RGB`` convert, plus
# several rounds of chroma-floor / sync-reject patches to paper over
# edge artefacts.  Each fix created a new one.  slowrx's model is
# fundamentally different, simpler, and known-good against real-world
# HF transmissions, so we port it wholesale.
#
# The three differences from our other decoders:
#
#   1. **Single-sample reads with a small local mean** (not a
#      windowed-central-60 % median).  slowrx reads one FFT-peak
#      frequency per pixel at the pixel centre; we approximate with a
#      5-sample mean of the Hilbert-derived instantaneous frequency
#      centred on each pixel.  That absorbs per-sample Hilbert noise
#      without pulling in neighbouring pixels or the chroma→sync
#      transition at the right edge.
#   2. **Nearest-neighbour chroma upsampling** (row-copy from the
#      adjacent native-chroma row).  slowrx does not interpolate; the
#      softer linear interpolation we tried first added complexity and
#      deferred-emission bookkeeping without meaningful image quality
#      gain.
#   3. **Direct integer YCbCr → RGB matrix**, bypassing PIL.  The
#      coefficients are slowrx's (rounded BT.601 full-range), expressed
#      as ``(100·Y + 140·Cr − 17850) / 100`` etc.  Numerically close to
#      PIL's convert-YCbCr but gives explicit, reproducible output
#      matching the reference bit-for-bit.
#
# The batch Robot 36 decoder in ``decoder.py`` retains the old
# median / PIL / nearest-neighbour path.  It is used only by the
# optional final slant-correction re-decode (which skips Robot 36 to
# avoid a pipeline mismatch) and the ``decode_wav`` / CLI entry point.
#
# slowrx itself does not implement the PySSTV per-line wire format,
# but the sampling model transfers cleanly; we support both wire
# formats with the same helpers and the ``Robot36IncrementalDecoder``
# wrapper auto-detects at feed time.

    One sync per image row.  Even rows carry Cr, odd rows carry Cb; the
    complementary chroma is filled by nearest-neighbour row copy from
    the immediately-adjacent opposite-parity row (slowrx's model).

    Emission: each sync produces one image row with the current row's
    Y plus best-available chroma.  Row N is emitted as soon as its sync
    is processed; when row N+1's sync later arrives, row N's missing-
    chroma plane is back-filled from row N+1 and the row is re-emitted.
    That re-emission produces a momentarily monotonicity break in
    ``lines_decoded`` (N+1 then N), but ``get_image()`` always returns

class Robot36IncrementalDecoder:
    """Auto-detecting streaming decoder for Robot 36.

    Robot 36 is transmitted in two mutually incompatible wire formats:

    * **Per-line** (PySSTV, slowrx): one sync pulse per image row,
      chroma alternating Cr / Cb line by line.  Inter-sync spacing is
      150 ms.
    * **Line-pair** (SimpleSSTV iOS, MMSSTV, most HF broadcasts): one
      sync pulse per two image rows, carrying shared Cr and Cb within
      the super-line.  Inter-sync spacing is 300 ms.

    The wire format can't be detected from the VIS code — both encode as
    0x08.  This wrapper buffers incoming audio until it has enough post-
    VIS sync candidates to measure the median inter-sync spacing, then
    constructs the appropriate backend and replays the buffered audio
    through it.

    Detection threshold is ``_DETECT_SYNC_COUNT`` candidates.  At 48 kHz
    this resolves within ~450 ms of audio for per-line (three 150 ms
    periods) or ~900 ms for line-pair (three 300 ms periods) — well
    under a single UI flush cycle, so the user sees no perceptible
    delay before rows start arriving.

    The class doesn't subclass ``IncrementalDecoderBase`` because the
    choice of line period and grid length is format-dependent; it
    duck-types the public API (``feed``, ``get_image``, ``complete``,
    ``image_height``, ``lines_decoded``, ``total_fed``) so
    ``Decoder._feed_decoding_incremental`` can treat it interchangeably.
