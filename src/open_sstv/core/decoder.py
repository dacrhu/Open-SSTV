"""Top-level SSTV decoder.

This module is the buffered front-end of the receive pipeline. It owns:

* a small audio ring buffer (so chunked feeds can be re-windowed without
  callers having to track absolute sample positions),
* the high-level state machine (idle → searching for VIS → decoding image),
* the dispatch into per-mode pixel decoders.

Phase 2 step 13 ships the **Robot 36** decoder. Step 14 adds Martin M1
and Scottie S1 per-mode functions plus a dual-layout Robot 36 path (see
below) — the ``Decoder.feed`` plumbing is mode-agnostic so each step
only touches the dispatch table.

Robot 36 has two wire formats in the wild:

* PySSTV's per-line layout — 240 sync pulses at 150 ms intervals,
  each followed by one Y and one chroma scan (Cr on even, Cb on odd).
* The canonical broadcast "line-pair" layout — 120 sync pulses at
  290 ms intervals, each followed by **two** Y scans and **two**
  chroma scans (Cr then Cb) with no sync between them. This is what
  SimpleSSTV iOS, MMSSTV, and most over-the-air encoders emit.

``decode_wav`` auto-detects the layout by measuring the median spacing
of raw sync candidates before walking the grid, then dispatches to
``_decode_robot36`` (single-line) or ``_decode_robot36_line_pair``.

Public API
----------

``decode_wav(samples, fs) -> DecodedImage | None``
    One-shot decode of an entire audio buffer. Returns the first complete
    image found, or ``None`` if no VIS or supported mode was detected.
    This is what the CLI and the round-trip tests call.

``Decoder``
    Streaming, pull-model API used by ``ui/workers.py``. Callers push
    audio chunks via ``feed(samples)`` and pop ``DecoderEvent`` objects
    describing what happened (``ImageStarted``, ``LineDecoded``,
    ``ImageComplete``). Internally it just buffers audio until enough is
    available to call ``decode_wav`` end-to-end — Phase 2 keeps the
    streaming wrapper deliberately dumb so we can iterate on the per-mode
    decoders without rewriting state-machine code.

Algorithm sketch (Robot 36)
---------------------------

PySSTV's encoder (verified by reading ``pysstv/color.py``) emits each
scan line as::

    1200 Hz sync ─ 9 ms
    1500 Hz porch ─ 3 ms
    Y scan ─ 88 ms (320 pixels @ 0.275 ms each)
    inter-channel gap ─ 4.5 ms
        2300 Hz on odd lines (sending Cb)
        1500 Hz on even lines (sending Cr)
    1900 Hz porch ─ 1.5 ms
    chroma scan ─ 44 ms (320 samples @ 0.1375 ms each)

Y is sent on every line; chroma alternates Cb (odd lines) / Cr (even
lines), so each pair of adjacent lines carries one full set of YCbCr.
The decoder pairs line N with line N+1, fills in the missing chroma
from its neighbor, and converts YCbCr→RGB via Pillow.

    Buffers audio chunks via ``feed(samples)``; the UI worker calls
    ``feed`` from its own thread as audio arrives. Each ``feed`` call
    returns a (possibly empty) list of ``DecoderEvent`` objects so the
    caller can react without polling.

    The decoder is a two-state machine:

    * **IDLE** — hunting for a VIS header. Each ``feed`` runs bandpass +
      ``detect_vis`` on the rolling window. On success, emits
      ``ImageStarted`` and transitions to DECODING.
    * **DECODING** — VIS is locked, accumulating scan lines.

      *Default path* (``incremental_decode=True``): each ``feed`` passes
      only the new audio tail to the per-mode ``IncrementalDecoder``.
      The decoder emits one ``ImageProgress`` per newly completed row,
      so the image appears line-by-line in O(1 line period) per flush.
      All 22 supported modes use this path.

      *Batch fallback* (``incremental_decode=False``): each ``feed``
      reruns bandpass + demod + sync + pixel decode over the full
      growing buffer. CPU cost is O(N) per flush → O(N²) total.

      In both cases the decoder emits ``ImageComplete`` when all scan
      lines are present, then auto-resets to IDLE.
