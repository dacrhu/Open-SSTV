"""Thread-safe RX audio capture pipeline.

This module bridges PortAudio's real-time callback thread to Qt's
signal/slot machinery. The design is the documented-safe pattern for
python-sounddevice plus long-running Qt workers:

* PortAudio callback (real-time thread) — copies ``indata`` into a
  ``queue.Queue.put_nowait`` call. **No DSP, no allocations beyond
  ``ndarray.copy()``, no Qt signal emission.** Blocking the callback
  for more than a frame period causes audible glitches; emitting Qt
  signals from non-Qt threads is technically legal but muddies the
  thread-affinity model, so we keep the callback minimal.

* ``InputStreamWorker`` (Qt worker thread) — ``moveToThread``'d onto
  its own ``QThread``. A ``QTimer`` on that thread drains the queue
  at a steady cadence and emits ``chunk_ready(np.ndarray)`` for each
  frame. Downstream consumers (the ``RxWorker``) connect via
  ``Qt.AutoConnection`` and receive chunks on their own threads.

The queue is bounded. Under normal load the UI consumer empties it
faster than PortAudio fills it; under a stall (GUI-thread freeze,
huge decode) we drop samples rather than grow the queue unbounded —
dropping a handful of 20 ms chunks is recoverable but leaking memory
across a multi-hour listening session is not.

Public API
----------

``InputStreamWorker(QObject)``
    Signals
    -------
    ``chunk_ready(object)`` — ``np.ndarray`` of ``float32`` mono samples.
    ``started()``            — emitted after the stream opens successfully.
    ``stopped()``            — emitted after the stream closes (clean or error).
    ``error(str)``           — emitted on stream construction / overrun / etc.

    Slots
    -----
    ``start(device, sample_rate, blocksize)`` — open the stream and begin
        capturing. ``device`` is an ``AudioDevice`` or a raw PortAudio index
        or ``None`` for the system default.
    ``stop()`` — close the stream and drain the queue.

DEFAULT_SAMPLE_RATE: int = 48_000

#: PortAudio frames per callback invocation. 1024 at 48 kHz is

#: consumer. At 1024 frames/chunk and 48 kHz that's ~5.4 s of audio
#: — plenty of slack for a transient GUI-thread stall without
#: letting a real stall grow memory forever. Overflow drops the
#: *newest* chunk, matching PortAudio's own ``input overflow``
#: semantics, and increments a drop counter surfaced via ``error``.
_QUEUE_MAXSIZE: int = 256

#: How often the worker thread drains the queue and emits signals.
#: 50 ms keeps UI latency well below one SSTV line while staying
#: coarse enough that the timer itself isn't hot. With the default
#: blocksize each drain pulls ~2–3 chunks.
_POLL_INTERVAL_MS: int = 50


#: How long the device watchdog waits for fresh audio before declaring the
#: input device lost (steady-state, after the first chunk has arrived).
#: 3 s gives ample slack for a brief system-level stall (suspend/resume,
#: driver reset) while still catching a genuine unplug within a few
#: seconds of the event.
_DEVICE_WATCHDOG_MS: int = 3000

#: Cold-start grace period before the watchdog engages.  Some USB audio
#: devices and Bluetooth SCO links take 1.5–2.5 s between
#: ``sd.InputStream.start()`` returning and the first PortAudio callback
#: firing; under thermal throttling or competing audio clients on
#: PipeWire/macOS this can push past 3 s and trip the watchdog spuriously
#: (OP-11).  6 s of cold-start budget covers the measured worst cases
#: while still catching a genuine "device never came up" failure well
#: below a human-patience threshold.

        After a USB audio device is hot-unplugged, PortAudio's internal host-API
        cache still points at the old (now invalid) device handle.  A subsequent
        ``sd.InputStream()`` open fails with PAErrorCode -10851 (Invalid Property
        Value) even when ``find_input_device_by_name`` has already resolved a
        fresh PortAudio index for the replugged device.  Calling
        ``Pa_Terminate()`` + ``Pa_Initialize()`` forces a full re-enumeration
        from the OS so the next stream open sees the device in its new state.

        Intra-process scope (H-7, audit 4.7/v0.2.9): this is a *process-wide*
        PortAudio operation.  Any other sounddevice streams in the same
        process (e.g. the TX output stream) are invalidated.  Open-SSTV's
        own TX/RX interlock prevents calling both simultaneously, but the
        user can still race the two paths (clicking RX Start while TX is
        mid-encode or mid-PTT-delay) — in that window terminating
        PortAudio would rip the host state out from under the live TX
        OutputStream and crash on the next callback.  The reset runs
        under ``run_if_tx_idle`` (M9, v0.3 audit) so the TX-idle check
        and the terminate/initialize are one atomic section — a TX
        starting concurrently blocks at its counter increment until the
        reset finishes (~100 ms) instead of racing it.  While TX is
        already active the reset is skipped (and logged); the caller
        proceeds without a fresh device cache, which is the right
        trade-off — at worst the user gets a -10851 if the device was
        just unplugged, which is recoverable; at best (the common case)
        nothing changed.

        Embedded-use caveat: if another component in the same Python
        process holds its own ``sd.OutputStream`` / ``sd.InputStream``
        (a co-resident ham-radio tool, a notebook, an IDE plugin), the
        ``is_tx_active`` interlock does *not* see it — only Open-SSTV's
        own TX activity.  A device-loss-recovery here can therefore kill
        an unrelated sibling stream.  This is a limitation of PortAudio's
        global host state, not of this code.  Open-SSTV ships as a
        standalone app, so the embedded case is mostly theoretical; the
        warning is here for anyone who later imports the package.

        Sounddevice-private-API defense (H-1, audit 4.7/v0.2.9):
        ``sd._terminate`` and ``sd._initialize`` are not part of the
        documented public sounddevice API (note the leading underscore).
        They have been stable through every release in our pinned range
        (``sounddevice>=0.4.6,<1``) but could disappear or be renamed in
        a future minor version.  The broad ``except Exception`` below is
        deliberately defensive: if the attributes are removed entirely,
        the attribute lookup itself raises ``AttributeError`` (a subclass
        of ``Exception``) and we degrade gracefully — the user gets a
        logged warning and a slightly stale device cache rather than a
        crash.  Do *not* tighten the except clause without verifying
        upstream's commitment to keeping the symbols around.
