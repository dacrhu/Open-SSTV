"""Reusable text-overlay renderer for PIL images.

Extracted from ``ImageEditorDialog._draw_text`` so the QSO template
system and the image editor can share the same rendering logic.

Overlay sizing and placement are both auto-fit:

* **Auto-shrink** — if the text is wider than the image at the
  requested font size (minus margins on both sides), the font size is
  reduced one point at a time down to :data:`_MIN_FONT_SIZE` until it
  fits.  This matters at the 320 px width most modes use, where the
  Exchange template's ``UR {rst} {date}`` overlay at 20 pt with a long
  callsign used to render wider than the frame and spill off the right
  edge.  (It mattered more when M2 / M4 / S2 / S4 were wrongly treated
  as 160 px wide; they are 320 like everything else — see issue #65.)
* **Clamp to bounds** — the final ``(x, y)`` is clamped so the text's
  four-direction shadow never crosses the image edge.  Applies to both
  named presets (``Top Center`` of an extra-wide string used to produce
  negative ``x``) and explicit Custom X/Y coordinates from the image
  editor spin boxes.
