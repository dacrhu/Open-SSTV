"""Background update checker.

Runs a single HTTPS GET against the GitHub releases API on a worker
thread so it never blocks the GUI.  If a newer version is found,
``update_available`` is emitted with the version string and the release
page URL.

The check times out after 3 seconds; any network error is silently
swallowed — an update check failing is never surfaced as an error.

M-8 (audit 4.7/v0.2.9): the GitHub unauthenticated REST API rate
limits at 60 requests/hour/IP.  A user behind a corporate NAT shares
that budget with every other Open-SSTV (or any other GitHub-API)
client on the same egress IP, so repeated app launches can blow
through the limit and silently no-op every subsequent check.  Cache
the last *successful* check timestamp in a sidecar file under
``platformdirs.user_cache_dir`` and skip the network round-trip if
the cache is fresher than ``_MIN_CHECK_INTERVAL_S`` (6 hours).  No
new AppConfig field — this is a transient runtime cache, not user
preference.

    Pre-release suffixes (``"0rc1"`` / ``"3a2"`` / ``"5.dev1"``) are
    stripped down to the leading digits — ``"v1.0.0rc1"`` → ``(1, 0, 0)``,
    which sorts equal to the matching stable release (``1.0.0``).  GitHub
    doesn't normally tag pre-releases as ``latest`` so this is a safety
    rail for forks / typos rather than the common path.

    Non-numeric segments with no leading digits (e.g. an entirely-letter
    tag like ``"main"``) become ``0`` so the comparison remains a tuple
    of integers.

    L6: previously each segment ran straight through ``int()`` and a
    non-numeric segment like ``"0rc1"`` raised ValueError → returned
    ``0``, meaning ``"v0.2.0rc1"`` parsed to ``(0, 2, 0)``.  That's the
    same as ``"v0.2.0"``, which is *correct* for the "is this a newer
    release" comparison.  But ``"v0.2.0a1"`` and ``"v0.2.0b1"`` and
    ``"v0.2.0rc1"`` all compare equal — fine if all three are tagged
