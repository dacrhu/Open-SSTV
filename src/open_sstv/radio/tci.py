"""TCI (Transceiver Control Interface) rig backend.

Implements the ``Rig`` Protocol for SDRs and transceivers that speak the
Expert Electronics TCI 1.x WebSocket protocol — primarily the SunSDR2 family
(SunSDR2 DX / Pro, ColibriNano) running ExpertSDR2, and compatible servers
such as HDSDR with the TCI plugin or SDR Console.

Protocol overview
-----------------
A single WebSocket connection (``ws://host:port``, default 40001) carries:

* **Text frames** — semicolon-terminated commands and event notifications.
  Examples::

      vfo:0,0,14074000;      # set / report VFO A of TRX 0 at 14.074 MHz
      modulation:0,USB;      # set / report demodulation mode
      trx:0,true;            # PTT on for TRX 0
      rx_smeter:0,0,-73;     # S-meter report (trx, channel, dBm)
      READY:                 # server initialised, ready for commands

* **Binary frames** — raw int16 LE PCM audio from the receiver.
  Frame layout (TCI v1, Expert Electronics)::

      Bytes 0-3 : uint32 LE — TRX index
      Bytes 4-7 : uint32 LE — channel index
      Bytes 8+  : int16 LE  — mono PCM samples

TCI is a **push-based protocol**.  The server sends state changes
proactively; it does not reliably respond to bare query commands.  All
getters therefore return the last value received from the server.  During
connection setup the server sends a full state snapshot (vfo, modulation,
trx, …) after ``READY:``, so by the time ``open()`` returns the cache is
populated.

Audio subscription is **not** managed by ``TciRig``.  ``TciInputStreamWorker``
(in ``open_sstv.audio.tci_input_stream``) handles the ``start:`` / ``stop:``
commands and receives audio via a callback registered on the shared
``TciConnection``.  Both objects share a single WebSocket session through the
``TciRig.connection`` attribute.

            ``self._sample_rate`` (the RX sample rate reported by the server)

        interleaved-stereo layout by checking whether consecutive sample pairs
        are within 1 × 10⁻⁶ of each other.  Silence frames (all zeros from
        CW inter-element gaps) always satisfy this test and are mis-classified
        as stereo, causing them to be processed as ``n/2`` stereo pairs and
        played at half duration — which corrupts CW timing.  We must patch
        individual samples, not just all-zero chunks: a mixed chunk (CW tone
        followed by inter-element silence) still has zero-pairs in its silent
        portion, which is enough to trigger the heuristic.  Alternating
        ±1 × 10⁻⁵ dither (~−100 dBFS, inaudible) replaces every near-zero
        sample so every pair (even_idx, odd_idx) = (+1e-5, −1e-5) — never
        equal — regardless of where the tone/silence boundary falls.
