"""TCP client for Hamlib's ``rigctld`` daemon.

We talk to ``rigctld`` (the network rig-control daemon shipped with hamlib)
over a plain TCP socket on port 4532. The wire protocol is one command per
line, ``\\n``-terminated.

**Why the daemon and not the SWIG bindings.** Hamlib's Python bindings
require building Hamlib from source with ``--with-python-binding``, which
breaks portability across distros and macOS. ``rigctld`` is shipped as
a daemon by every hamlib package on every supported platform and the
on-the-wire protocol has been stable for over a decade. The cost is one
process boundary; the benefit is reaching hundreds of supported radios
with a 200-line client.

**Why ``+`` extended responses.** rigctld's default protocol has no
consistent per-command terminator: set commands return ``RPRT N`` but
get commands return raw values, so a client has to know exactly how many
lines each command emits to read the right number of bytes. Prefixing
every command with ``+`` switches the daemon into the extended response
mode, where every response — set or get — ends with a single ``RPRT N``
line. We just read until we see that line and we never have to special-case
command shapes.

**Threading.** A single ``threading.Lock`` serializes ``_send_recv``, so
the UI poll thread and the TX worker can never interleave bytes on the
same socket. The lock is held for the whole send-then-receive sequence,
not just the send, because the response is what closes the transaction.

**Reconnection.** Lazy connect on the first command (so construction can't
fail just because the daemon isn't up yet) and one automatic reconnect on
``BrokenPipeError`` / ``ConnectionResetError`` per command. If the second
attempt also fails, raise ``RigConnectionError`` and let the UI surface
it as a non-modal status bar message.
