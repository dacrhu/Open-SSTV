## 1. What Is SSTV?

Slow-Scan Television (SSTV) is a method of transmitting still images over radio. Unlike broadcast television, which sends 25 or 30 full frames per second, SSTV sends a single image over a period of roughly 36 seconds to two minutes, depending on the mode. The image is encoded as audio tones: each horizontal line of the picture is converted into a sweep of frequencies between 1500 Hz (black) and 2300 Hz (white), and a short 1200 Hz sync pulse marks the boundary between lines.

SSTV is popular among amateur (ham) radio operators, particularly on the HF bands (most commonly 14.230 MHz USB for 20 meters and 3.845 MHz LSB for 75 meters). Operators exchange images of their stations, antennas, scenery, QSL cards, and—most often—images with their callsign, a signal report, and a greeting. SSTV works on any voice-capable radio: HF, VHF, UHF, and even through amateur satellites and the International Space Station.

No special hardware is required beyond a radio and a computer with a sound card. The computer generates the audio tones for transmission and decodes received tones back into an image.

## 2. About Open-SSTV

Open-SSTV is a free, open-source, cross-platform SSTV transceiver for amateur radio operators, developed by Kevin, W0AEZ. It provides a graphical application for transmitting and receiving SSTV images as well as headless command-line tools for encoding and decoding. The project is built with Python and Qt 6 (PySide6) and runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

Key features at a glance:

- **Transmit and receive** SSTV images with a modern Qt 6 interface
- **22 SSTV modes** across the Robot, Martin, Scottie, PD, Wraase SC2, and Pasokon families
- **Real-time progressive decode** — watch the image appear line by line as it is received
- **Automatic VIS detection** — the app identifies the incoming SSTV mode automatically
- **Built-in image editor** with crop, rotate, flip, and text overlays
- **QSO templates** — one-click callsign and exchange overlays for fast on-air operation
- **Rig control** via Hamlib's rigctld daemon or direct serial CAT (Icom CI-V, Kenwood, Yaesu) with PTT keying
- **PTT-only serial mode** for rigs without full CAT support (DTR or RTS line keying)
- **Audio device selection** with adjustable input/output gain
- **Image gallery** showing the 20 most-recent decoded images
- **Auto-save** option for received images
- **Slant correction** — compensates for TX/RX sound card clock drift
- **Headless CLI tools** for encoding and decoding WAV files (suitable for Raspberry Pi or CI pipelines)

---

## 3. Installation and Setup

### 3.1 System Requirements

- **Python 3.11 or later**
- **A sound card** (built-in works, but a USB audio interface is recommended for cleaner audio when connected to a radio)
- **A radio** (any voice-capable amateur radio — HF, VHF, or UHF) if you want to go on the air. You can test the app without a radio by playing and recording audio through your sound card.
- **Operating system**: Linux, macOS, or Windows. The GUI requires a display server (X11 or Wayland on Linux, or the native desktop on macOS/Windows).

### 3.2 Installing from Source

Clone the repository and install in a virtual environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bucknova/Open-SSTV.git
cd Open-SSTV
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

This installs the `open-sstv` command (the GUI), plus `open-sstv-encode` and `open-sstv-decode` (the command-line tools). Omit `[dev]` if you don't need the test/lint/type-check extras.

**Dependencies installed automatically**: PySide6 ≥ 6.6, NumPy ≥ 1.26, SciPy ≥ 1.11, sounddevice ≥ 0.4.6 (PortAudio), PySSTV ≥ 0.5.6, Pillow ≥ 10.1, pyserial ≥ 3.5, platformdirs ≥ 4.0, tomli-w ≥ 1.0. Python 3.11 or later is required.

On Linux you may also need PortAudio development headers. On Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install libportaudio2
```

To launch the GUI:

```bash
open-sstv
```

Or run as a Python module:

```bash
python -m open_sstv
```

### 3.3 Command-Line Tools

Two headless CLI tools are available for use without the GUI, useful on headless machines, Raspberry Pi devices, or in automated scripts:

- `open-sstv-encode` — Render an image to an SSTV WAV file
- `open-sstv-decode` — Decode an SSTV WAV file back into an image

These tools do not require PySide6 or a display and can run in any terminal.

---

## 4. Quick Start

1. **Launch the app**: Run `open-sstv` from a terminal.
2. **Set your callsign**: Go to **File > Settings**, open the **Radio** tab, and enter your callsign in the Callsign field. Click OK.
3. **Choose your audio devices**: In **File > Settings > Audio**, select the input device your radio feeds audio into and the output device that feeds audio to your radio. If you are just testing, leave both on "System default."
4. **To receive**: Click **Start Capture** on the right-side Receive panel. The app will listen for SSTV signals. When it detects a VIS header, it will automatically identify the mode and begin decoding the image line by line.
5. **To transmit**: Click **Load Image** on the left-side Transmit panel, pick an image, select an SSTV mode from the dropdown, and click **Transmit**. If rig control is connected, the app will key your PTT automatically.

---

## 5. How a Typical SSTV QSO Works

A QSO (amateur radio contact) on SSTV follows a pattern similar to a voice contact, but images replace spoken exchanges. Here is the typical flow:

**1. Tune to an SSTV frequency.** The most popular calling frequencies are 14.230 MHz USB (20 m) and 3.845 MHz LSB (75 m). On VHF, 145.500 MHz FM is sometimes used.

**2. Listen first.** Before transmitting, listen for a minute or two to make sure the frequency is clear. Start a capture in Open-SSTV and watch for incoming signals. The waterfall or status bar will show activity.

**3. Call CQ.** When the frequency is clear, prepare an image with your callsign and "CQ" (the general call for any station). Open-SSTV's built-in CQ template places text like "CQ CQ CQ DE [YOURCALL] K" onto your image automatically. Select your SSTV mode (Robot 36 is the most common for quick exchanges), then click Transmit. The transmission takes 36 seconds for Robot 36, about 110 seconds for Scottie S1 or Martin M1.

**4. Wait for a reply.** After your CQ image finishes transmitting, switch back to receive and listen. An answering station will send an image addressed to your callsign with their callsign and a signal report.

**5. Exchange images.** When you receive a reply, use the Exchange template to send an image back with their callsign, your callsign, and a signal report (RST — typically "59" for a good signal). The exchange template fills in "{theircall} DE {mycall}" and "UR {rst}" automatically; you just type in their callsign and the report when prompted.

**6. Send 73.** To close the contact, send a final image with "73" (best regards) using the 73 template. The other station may send a 73 image back as well.

**7. Log the contact.** After the QSO, log the contact in your station logbook with the date, time (UTC), frequency, mode (SSTV), callsigns, and signal reports.

Throughout the QSO, each station takes turns transmitting and receiving. Robot 36 is preferred for quick exchanges because each image takes only 36 seconds. For higher-quality pictures (scenery, detailed QSL cards), operators may switch to Martin M1 or Scottie S1, which take longer but produce larger, sharper images.

## 6. The Main Window

When Open-SSTV launches, the main window is divided into three areas: a radio status toolbar across the top, a Transmit panel on the left, and a Receive panel on the right.

![Open-SSTV main window](docs/screenshots/main-window.png)

### 6.1 Radio Panel (Toolbar)

The toolbar at the top of the window shows your rig connection status and live radio information.

From left to right, the toolbar displays: a **Connect Rig / Disconnect** button, a **connection status indicator** ("Connected" in green, "Disconnected" in gray, or "Connection lost" in red), the **current frequency** displayed in MHz, kHz, or Hz (or "—" if no rig is connected), the **radio mode** (USB, LSB, FM, etc.), an **S-meter** bar (scaled from S0 to S9), and your **callsign** displayed prominently on the right side.

When a rig is connected, the app polls the radio once per second and updates the frequency, mode, and signal strength displays automatically.

### 6.2 Transmit Panel (Left)

The left side of the window is dedicated to preparing and sending SSTV images.

At the top is the **image preview area** (minimum 320x240 pixels), which shows either a placeholder message ("No image loaded") or the image you have loaded and edited.

Below the preview is the **QSO template bar** — a row of buttons for quickly overlaying callsign and exchange text onto your image. The default templates are CQ, Exchange, and 73. There is also a Clear Text button (to remove template overlays) and a gear icon to open the template editor.

Below the template bar are the controls: a **Mode dropdown** (showing the mode name, resolution, and approximate duration for each mode), a **Load Image** button (opens a file picker supporting PNG, JPEG, BMP, GIF, TIFF, and WebP), an **Edit Image** button (opens the image editor for cropping, rotating, and adding text), and the **Transmit** button which starts the transmission.

During transmission, the Transmit button is replaced by a **Stop** button, and a **progress bar** appears showing the percentage complete along with elapsed and total time in seconds.

A **status label** at the bottom displays messages about image loading, template application, and any errors.

### 6.3 Receive Panel (Right)

The right side of the window handles SSTV reception.

The layout mirrors the transmit side: an **image preview area** at the top that shows the image currently being decoded (or the most recently completed image), followed by control buttons and status information.

The controls include a **Start Capture / Stop Capture** toggle button, a **Clear** button (resets the decoder to hunt for a new VIS header), and a **Save Image** button (saves the most recently decoded image).

The **status label** shows the detected mode name, VIS code, and decode progress (for example, "Robot 36 — VIS 8 — 180/240 lines").

At the bottom is the **image gallery** — a horizontal strip of thumbnails showing up to 20 recently decoded images, with the newest on the left. Double-click a thumbnail to save it, or right-click for a context menu with "Save As..." and "Copy to Clipboard" options.

Along the right edge of the Receive panel is a slim **audio strip** with three vertical controls: a **TX gain** slider, an **RX gain** slider, and an input-level meter. The two sliders are the same software-gain values found in Settings → Audio → Software Gain — dragging one takes effect immediately, and releasing it saves the value so it persists across restarts and shows up in the Settings dialog. The **input-level meter** is a colour-zoned dBFS bar (green = healthy, yellow = hot, red = clipping) with a slowly falling peak-hold marker; it moves while capture is running and reflects the level *after* the RX gain slider, so you can raise RX gain until the meter sits comfortably in the green without touching red.

### 6.4 Menu Bar

The **File** menu contains **Settings** (opens the configuration dialog) and **Quit**.

The **Tools** menu (v0.4) contains **Logbook…** (keyboard shortcut **Ctrl+L**, **Cmd+L** on macOS), which opens the QSO logbook in its own window — see [Section 18](#18-the-logbook-v04).  It also contains **Gallery…** (**Ctrl+G** / **Cmd+G**), which opens the image browser — see [Section 19](#19-the-gallery-v05).

The **Help** menu contains **About**, which shows the application name, version, and license.

The keyboard shortcut **Ctrl+S** saves the most recently decoded image (same as clicking Save Image on the Receive panel).

---

## 7. Receiving Images

### 7.1 Starting a Capture

Click **Start Capture** on the Receive panel. The app begins listening on your selected audio input device. The status label will show "Listening..." while the app watches for a VIS header.

Make sure your audio input device is set correctly in Settings (or that the system default device is receiving audio from your radio). The app expects audio at the configured sample rate (48 kHz by default, or 44.1 kHz).

### 7.2 Progressive Decode

When the app detects a valid VIS header in the incoming audio, it automatically identifies the SSTV mode and begins decoding. The status label updates to show the detected mode and VIS code — for example, "Robot 36 — VIS 8 — Decoding..."

The image appears in the preview area line by line as it is decoded. Undecoded lines appear as black rows. The status updates periodically with the count of decoded lines versus total lines (for example, "120/240 lines").

When decoding completes, the status shows "Decode complete" and the finished image is added to the gallery strip. The decoder then automatically resets to hunt for the next VIS header, so you can receive multiple images in succession without any manual intervention.

The app includes automatic **slant correction**: if the transmitting and receiving sound cards have slightly different clock rates (which is common and causes the decoded image to lean to one side), the decoder fits a line through the detected sync pulse positions and compensates for the drift. This produces a straight image even with imperfect clocks.

### 7.3 The Image Gallery

The gallery at the bottom of the Receive panel holds up to 20 thumbnails (160x120 pixels each) of recently decoded images, displayed newest-first (left to right). When a 21st image arrives, the oldest one is dropped.

Three interactions, each with a different intent:
- **Single-click** — surface the thumbnail in the Receive panel's main preview *and* pin it as the active RX image for any v0.3 reply template (see [13.10](#1310-rx-to-tx-image-workflow)). Use this to review an older decode at full size or to set up a one-click reply.
- **Double-click** — open a Save As… dialog so you can write the image to disk.
- **Right-click** — context menu with **View** (same as single-click), **Save As…**, and **Copy to Clipboard** (places the image on the system clipboard for pasting into other applications).

### 7.4 Saving Received Images

There are several ways to save a decoded image:

- Click the **Save Image** button on the Receive panel, which saves the most recently decoded image.
- Press **Ctrl+S** anywhere in the app.
- Double-click a gallery thumbnail.
- Right-click a gallery thumbnail and choose "Save As..."
- Enable **auto-save** in Settings (Images tab). When auto-save is on, every completed decode is saved automatically to your configured save directory. Files are named with the mode and a timestamp, for example `sstv_robot_36_20260413_143022.png`.

The default save directory is `~/Pictures/open_sstv`. You can change this in **File > Settings > Images**.

---

## 8. Transmitting Images

### 8.1 Loading an Image

Click **Load Image** on the Transmit panel. A file dialog opens supporting these formats: PNG, JPEG, BMP, GIF, TIFF, and WebP. After selecting an image, it appears in the preview area and the Edit Image and Transmit buttons become enabled.

The app will automatically resize your image to match the selected SSTV mode's native resolution when transmitting. You can also crop and resize it manually using the image editor.

#### Image fit status

After loading an image, a coloured status bar appears below the preview showing how your image compares to the selected mode's target dimensions:

- **Green — "…matches … target — TX will encode at native resolution."**  Your image is already the exact pixel dimensions for the selected mode. No scaling of any kind will occur.

- **Green — "…aspect matches; LANCZOS resize on TX, no distortion."**  Your image has the correct aspect ratio (width-to-height proportion) but a different pixel size. The app will scale it up or down using LANCZOS resampling — the highest-quality resize algorithm, which preserves sharp edges and fine detail. The result looks exactly like your original, just at a different size.

- **Amber — "…aspect mismatch; image will be stretched."**  Your image's proportions don't match the selected mode. Transmitting as-is will stretch it to fit, which distorts faces and shapes. To fix this, use **Edit Image → Auto-fit Crop** to trim the image to the correct aspect ratio before transmitting.

**What is LANCZOS?**  LANCZOS (also written Lanczos) is a mathematical resampling filter that produces the sharpest, most accurate results when enlarging or shrinking an image. It is the same algorithm used by professional photo editing software. You do not need to do anything to enable it — the app uses it automatically whenever a resize is needed.

### 8.2 Editing an Image

Click **Edit Image** to open the image editor dialog. The editor provides the following tools.

**Crop**: A yellow dashed rectangle appears over the image. Drag it to select a crop region, or type exact X, Y, width, and height values in the spin boxes on the right. The "Lock Aspect Ratio" toggle constrains the crop to the target mode's aspect ratio (typically 4:3). Click "Auto-fit Crop" to calculate the largest centered crop at the correct aspect ratio, then "Apply Crop" to commit the crop. "Reset" reverts to the original image.

**Transform**: Four buttons let you rotate left (90 degrees counterclockwise), rotate right (90 degrees clockwise), flip horizontally, and flip vertically.

**Text Overlays**: Enter text (such as your callsign) in the text field, set the font size (8 to 120 pixels), and pick a colour via the colour picker. For placement you have two options:

- **Named presets** — pick from the Position dropdown: Top Left, Top Center, Top Right, Center, Bottom Left, Bottom Center, Bottom Right. The X and Y spin boxes auto-fill to the preset's computed pixel coordinates.
- **Custom X/Y** — type exact pixel values into the X and Y spin boxes (5-pixel step) for precise placement. The Position dropdown automatically switches to "Custom" when you edit the spin boxes manually.

Click "Add Text" to stack overlays. Each one appears in the overlay list. Select an overlay and click "Remove" to delete it. Text is rendered with a dark shadow for readability on any background.

An info label at the bottom of the editor shows the current image dimensions, the target dimensions for the selected mode, and the number of text layers. When you click OK, all overlays are burned into the image and it is resized to the mode's native dimensions with high-quality LANCZOS resampling.

### 8.3 Choosing an SSTV Mode

The Mode dropdown on the Transmit panel lists every supported mode — all 22 of them. Each entry shows the mode name, resolution, and approximate transmission duration. Common choices:

- **Robot 36** — 320 × 240, ~36 s. The fastest and most commonly used mode for casual QSOs worldwide.
- **Martin M1** — 320 × 256, ~114 s. The most popular mode in Europe. Higher colour fidelity than Robot 36 but ~3× longer.
- **Scottie S1** — 320 × 256, ~110 s. The most popular mode in the United States. Sync sits mid-line (between blue and red channels).
- **PD-90 / PD-120** — 320 × 256 / 640 × 496, ~90 s / ~126 s. Popular for high-quality exchanges; PD uses Y′CbCr with line-pair chroma sub-sampling.
- **Pasokon P3** — 640 × 496, ~203 s. Largest common mode still under 4 minutes.

See [Section 9: SSTV Modes Reference](#9-sstv-modes-reference) for the complete table of all 22 modes with durations, VIS codes, resolutions, and colour systems.

Robot 36 is the fastest mode and is the default choice for calling CQ. The longer Martin, Scottie, PD, Wraase, and Pasokon modes produce larger, sharper images at the cost of transmission time — worth it for QSL-card-style exchanges where you want the detail.

You can set a default TX mode in **File > Settings > Images** so that it is pre-selected each time you launch the app.

### 8.4 Template Gallery & QSO State

v0.3 replaces the old text-overlay button bar with a full **template compositor**: each template is a stack of layered elements (photo, text, banners, gradients) authored once and re-rendered at TX time with your live QSO data. The TX panel exposes two new widgets for this:

**Template Gallery** — A scrollable grid of thumbnails showing every template you have, each rendered live with your current TX photo and QSO state so the previews look exactly like what will go out on the air. Filter chips above the grid (**All / CQ / Reply / 73 / Custom**) narrow the list by role. Click a thumbnail to select it for transmission; the selected card is highlighted. Use the **+ New…** button to author a new template, or right-click any thumbnail for **Edit / Duplicate / Rename / Delete**. Double-clicking a thumbnail opens it in the editor.

**QSO State** — Three small fields next to the gallery: **ToCall**, **RST**, and **Name**. These feed the live tokens (`%o` / `{tocall}`, `%r` / `{rst}`, `%name_o` / `{tocallname}`) inside every template, so you type the callsign once and every layer that references it updates in every preview at the same time. RST defaults to `595`. The fields persist for the current QSO and clear when you start a new one.

When you click **Transmit**, the selected template is composited at the chosen mode's native resolution (your photo plus all layers, with tokens resolved against the current QSO state and rig frequency) and encoded directly — no separate "burn-in" step is needed.

For full editor coverage, layer types, and the token cheat sheet, see [Section 13: Templates In Depth](#13-templates-in-depth-v03).

![Template editor](docs/screenshots/template-editor.png)

### 8.5 Sending the Transmission

Once your image is loaded (and optionally edited and templated), click **Transmit**. Here is what happens:

1. The image is encoded into SSTV audio samples for the selected mode.
2. If a rig is connected, the app keys PTT (press-to-talk) on your radio.
3. The app waits for the configured PTT delay (default 0.2 seconds) to allow the radio's relay to settle.
4. The audio is played through your selected output device.
5. The progress bar shows percentage complete and elapsed/total seconds.
6. When playback finishes, PTT is released.

To abort a transmission in progress, click **Stop**. The audio stops immediately, PTT is released, and the status shows "Transmission aborted."

If no rig control is connected (Manual mode), the app simply plays the audio and you are responsible for keying your radio manually — either by pressing your radio's PTT button or using VOX (voice-activated transmit).

## 9. SSTV Modes Reference

Open-SSTV supports **22 SSTV transmission modes** across six families. Every SSTV transmission begins with a VIS (Vertical Interval Signaling) header — a short sequence of tones that identifies the mode so the receiving station's software can decode it automatically.

| Mode | VIS (dec / hex) | Resolution | Duration | Colour System | Sync Position |
|------|-----------------|------------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| Robot 36 | 8 / 0x08 | 320 × 240 | ~36 s | YCbCr (line-pair) | Line start |
| Martin M1 | 44 / 0x2C | 320 × 256 | ~114 s | RGB (G, B, R order) | Line start |
| Martin M2 | 40 / 0x28 | 160 × 256 | ~58 s | RGB (G, B, R order) | Line start |
| Martin M3 | 36 / 0x24 | 320 × 128 | ~57 s | RGB (G, B, R order) | Line start |
| Martin M4 | 32 / 0x20 | 160 × 128 | ~29 s | RGB (G, B, R order) | Line start |
| Scottie S1 | 60 / 0x3C | 320 × 256 | ~110 s | RGB (G, B, R order) | Before red (mid-line) |
| Scottie S2 | 56 / 0x38 | 160 × 256 | ~71 s | RGB (G, B, R order) | Before red (mid-line) |

| Scottie S4 | 48 / 0x30 | 160 × 128 | ~36 s | RGB (G, B, R order) | Before red (mid-line) |
| PD-50 | 93 / 0x5D | 320 × 256 | ~50 s | YCbCr (line-pair) | Line start |
| PD-90 | 99 / 0x63 | 320 × 256 | ~90 s | YCbCr (line-pair) | Line start |

### 9.1 Mode Families

**Robot 36** uses a Y′CbCr colour system similar to analog television. One sync pulse covers two image rows ("line-pair" format): the even row's luminance, a shared Cr (red chroma) component, the odd row's luminance, and a shared Cb (blue chroma) component. The chroma sub-sampling is what makes Robot 36 fast — it sends colour information at half vertical resolution. Open-SSTV's encoder emits the canonical line-pair format (the same format MMSSTV / SimpleSSTV / QSSTV / slowrx produce and expect); PySSTV's upstream `Robot36` class emits a non-standard per-line format that most real-world decoders cannot decode, so Open-SSTV transparently substitutes its own encoder. On receive, both wire formats are auto-detected from the inter-sync spacing (150 ms per-line vs 300 ms line-pair).

**Martin** family (M1, M2, M3, M4) sends full RGB with a sync pulse at the start of each line. Channel order is G → B → R, separated by short 0.572 ms porches. M1 is the most popular mode in Europe; M2 is the half-width variant (160 × 256); M3 and M4 are 128-row versions of M1 and M2 respectively.

**Scottie** family (S1, S2, DX, S3, S4) also sends full RGB, but the sync pulse sits mid-line, *between* the blue and red channels rather than at the start. Each line's layout is: green scan → blue scan → sync pulse → red scan. This mid-line sync is historically the most common source of off-by-one bugs in SSTV decoders and is handled explicitly in Open-SSTV's Scottie decoder. S1 is the most popular mode in the United States. DX is a wide-scan, high-quality variant at ~269 s.

**PD** family (PD-50, 90, 120, 160, 180, 240, 290) is a line-pair Y′CbCr mode like Robot 36, but with four equal-duration channel scans per super-line (Y0, Cr, Cb, Y1) instead of two plus alternating chroma. PD modes produce larger images with smoother chroma than the Martin/Scottie/Wraase RGB modes at the same duration. PD-290 is 800 × 616 — the highest-resolution mode Open-SSTV supports.

**Wraase SC2** family (SC2-120, SC2-180) sends full RGB back-to-back after a single porch at the start of the line — no inter-channel gaps. Channel order is R → G → B. Less common than Martin / Scottie but still seen on air.

**Pasokon** family (P3, P5, P7) sends full RGB with four equal gaps flanking three equal-width RGB scans. Pasokon P7 at 406 s is the longest mode Open-SSTV ships and produces very high-detail 640 × 496 images.

All modes use the same frequency-to-brightness mapping: **1500 Hz is black and 2300 Hz is white**, with a linear scale between them. **Sync pulses are at 1200 Hz.** The VIS leader is 1900 Hz.

### 9.2 Modes Not Yet Supported

The Robot 8, Robot 12, Robot 24, and Robot 72 modes are not yet supported because they use a YCbCr 4:2:2 sub-sampling that differs from Robot 36's 4:2:0-ish pattern and requires a custom encoder PySSTV doesn't provide. These are tracked for a future release.

---

## 10. Radio and Rig Control

Open-SSTV supports three rig control modes, configured in **File > Settings > Radio**.

### 10.1 Manual Mode (No Rig Control)

Select **"Manual (no rig control)"** in the Connection Mode dropdown. In this mode, the app does not communicate with your radio at all. You must key PTT yourself — either by pressing your radio's PTT switch, using a foot switch, or enabling VOX on your radio so it transmits whenever it hears audio.

The Radio Panel toolbar will show "Disconnected" and the frequency, mode, and S-meter displays will show placeholder values. This mode is useful for simple setups, testing, or if your radio doesn't support CAT control.

### 10.2 rigctld (Hamlib Daemon)

Select **"rigctld (Hamlib daemon)"** for the most flexible rig control option. This uses Hamlib's `rigctld` daemon, which supports hundreds of radio models and communicates over a TCP socket.

**How it works**: The `rigctld` daemon runs as a separate process (either started manually or launched by Open-SSTV). It connects to your radio over a serial port and provides a network API. Open-SSTV connects to the daemon over TCP (default: localhost port 4532) and sends commands to read frequency, mode, and signal strength, as well as key and unkey PTT.

**Setup steps**:

1. Install Hamlib on your system. On Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install hamlib-utils`. On macOS with Homebrew: `brew install hamlib`.
2. In the Settings dialog's Radio tab, select "rigctld (Hamlib daemon)."
3. Set the **Host** (default: `localhost`) and **Port** (default: `4532`).
4. Select your **Radio Model** from the dropdown. The list includes popular models from Icom, Kenwood, Yaesu, and Elecraft. If your model isn't listed, enter its Hamlib model number in the "Custom Model ID" field (consult `rigctld --list` for all models).
5. Set the **Serial Port** to the port your radio is connected to (for example, `/dev/cu.usbserial-1420` on macOS, `/dev/ttyUSB0` on Linux, or `COM3` on Windows).
6. Set the **Baud Rate** to match your radio's configuration (common values: 9600, 19200, 38400, 115200).
7. Optionally check **Auto-launch rigctld** to have the app start the daemon for you when you click Connect Rig.
8. Alternatively, click **Launch rigctld Now** to start the daemon immediately from the settings dialog. The status label will confirm if it started successfully. Use **Stop rigctld** to terminate it.
9. Click **Test rigctld Connection** to verify the connection. If successful, the dialog will display your radio's current frequency and mode.
10. Click OK to save settings.

Back in the main window, click **Connect Rig** on the toolbar. The status indicator should turn green and the frequency, mode, and S-meter will begin updating every second.

### 10.3 Direct Serial (Built-In CAT)

Select **"Direct Serial (built-in)"** to have Open-SSTV communicate directly with your radio over serial, without needing rigctld or Hamlib installed. This is a simpler setup but supports a smaller set of radio families.

**Supported protocols**:

- **Icom CI-V** — For Icom radios (IC-7300, IC-705, IC-7100, IC-9700, IC-7200, IC-7600, IC-7000, IC-7851, IC-R8600, and others). Provides full CAT control: frequency, mode, PTT, and S-meter.
- **Kenwood** — For Kenwood radios (TS-590SG, TS-890S, TS-480, TS-2000) and Elecraft radios (K3, KX3, KX2, K4). Full CAT control.
- **Yaesu** — For modern Yaesu radios (FT-991A, FT-891, FT-710, FTDX10, FTDX101, FT-950). Full CAT control.
- **PTT Only (DTR/RTS)** — For any radio. Toggles the DTR or RTS serial control line to key PTT. No frequency, mode, or S-meter readback. This is the simplest option if you only need automated PTT.

**Setup steps**:

1. In Settings > Radio, select "Direct Serial (built-in)."
2. Choose the **Protocol** from the dropdown.
3. Select the **Serial Port** (the dropdown lists detected ports; you can also type a custom path).
4. Set the **Baud Rate** to match your radio.
5. For **Icom CI-V**: Choose your radio from the CI-V Address Preset dropdown (this auto-fills the hex address), or enter the address manually. Common addresses: IC-7300 = 0x94, IC-705 = 0xA4, IC-9700 = 0xA2.
6. For **PTT Only**: Choose the **PTT Line** — either DTR or RTS, depending on your cable wiring.
7. Click **Test Serial Connection** to verify. A successful test displays the radio's frequency and mode (or just confirms PTT line toggling for PTT-only mode).
8. Click OK, then click **Connect Rig** in the main window.

### 10.4 TCI (ExpertSDR / SunSDR)

TCI is a WebSocket protocol spoken by ExpertSDR2 / ExpertSDR3, the SunSDR2
family, the AetherSDR, and [Lyra](https://github.com/N8SDR1/Lyra-SDR-cpp) (a Hermes Lite 2 transceiver). It is the
only backend that carries **both**
rig control **and** audio over a single connection — with TCI selected you
do not need a virtual audio cable or a second sound device.

1. Start your SDR software and enable its TCI server (default port `40001`).
2. **Settings → Radio → Mode: TCI (ExpertSDR2 / SunSDR)**.
3. Enter the **TCI host** (`127.0.0.1` if the SDR software runs on this
   machine) and **port**.
4. Choose the **SSTV mode** for Band Plan tuning. **Voice** keeps the SDR
   in DIGU / DIGL if it's already there and only changes the frequency.
   **Data/Pkt** switches it into DIGU / DIGL. **Don't change mode** leaves
   the mode alone entirely.
5. Click OK, then **Connect Rig**.

RX audio arrives over the same connection and replaces the sound-card
input automatically, so the Audio tab's input device is ignored while TCI
is connected.

### 10.5 FlexRadio (Direct SmartSDR)

FlexRadio 6000-series radios can be controlled **directly** over the
SmartSDR TCP API — no `rigctld` and no virtual serial port in between.

1. **Settings → Radio → Mode: FlexRadio (direct, SmartSDR)**.
2. Enter the **radio's own IP address** — not this computer's. (Find it in
   SmartSDR, or on the radio's front panel.)
3. Leave the **API port** at `4992` unless you have changed it.
4. Choose the **Slice** to follow: `0` is slice A, `1` is slice B, and so
   on. The slice must be **active in SmartSDR** — if it isn't, the
   connection test says so rather than silently reading 0.000 MHz.
5. Choose the **SSTV mode** for Band Plan tuning, as for TCI above.
   **Data/Pkt** puts the slice in DIGU / DIGL, and **Voice** keeps it there
   if it's already in one.
6. Click **Test FlexRadio Connection** to confirm, then OK and
   **Connect Rig**.

Unlike TCI this is **CAT only** — audio still comes from your sound
device, so set DAX (or whatever you use) as the input and output on the
Audio tab as usual.

> **S-meter:** not available on this path. FlexRadio streams meter values
> as VITA-49 packets over a separate UDP socket, which Open-SSTV does not
> implement; the S-meter reads 0. Frequency, mode, and PTT all work
> normally.

### 10.6 Supported Radios and Protocols

The following radios have been tested or have built-in presets in the settings dialog.

**Via Direct Serial (Icom CI-V)**: IC-7300, IC-7610, IC-9700, IC-705, IC-7100, IC-7200, IC-7600, IC-7000, IC-7851, IC-R8600.

**Via Direct Serial (Kenwood)**: TS-590SG, TS-890S, TS-480, TS-2000, and Elecraft K3, KX3, KX2, K4.

**Via Direct Serial (Yaesu)**: FT-991A, FT-891, FT-710, FTDX10, FTDX101, FT-950.

**Via TCI**: Expert Electronics SunSDR2 family (PRO / DX / MB1) and the AetherSDR, through ExpertSDR2 / ExpertSDR3; and the Hermes Lite 2 / 2+ through [Lyra](https://github.com/N8SDR1/Lyra-SDR-cpp), with Band Plan DIGU / DIGL switching confirmed by its author, N8SDR.

**Via FlexRadio direct**: the 6000 series — FLEX-6300/6400/6500/6600/6700 and the 6400M/6600M — over the SmartSDR TCP API.

**Via rigctld (Hamlib)**: Hundreds of additional models — any radio supported by Hamlib. Run `rigctld --list` in a terminal for the full list. Common models included in the Open-SSTV dropdown are (Hamlib model IDs as of v4.5+):

- Icom IC-7300 = **1035**, IC-7610 = **1036**, IC-9700 = **1037**, IC-705 = **1039**, IC-7100 = **1029**, IC-7200 = **1034**
- Kenwood TS-590SG = **3073**, TS-890S = **3085**, TS-480 = **3077**, TS-2000 = **3061**
- Yaesu FT-991A = **2057**, FT-891 = **2055**, FTDX10 = **2063**, FT-710 = **2053**, FTDX101 = **2060**, FT-817/818 = **2028**, FT-950 = **2040**
- Elecraft K3 = **4010**, KX3 = **4013**, KX2 = **4014**, K4 = **4015**
- Hamlib Dummy (for testing without hardware) = **1**, NET rigctl (for daemon-to-daemon) = **2**

If your radio isn't in the Open-SSTV preset list, enter the Hamlib model number directly in the "Custom Model ID" field.

**PTT-only serial**: Works with any radio that has a serial PTT interface — no CAT protocol required.

### 10.7 PTT Delay

When transmitting with rig control, the app keys PTT and then waits for a configurable delay before playing audio. This gives your radio's transmit relay time to engage so the beginning of the SSTV signal is not clipped.

The default PTT delay is **0.2 seconds** (200 ms). You can adjust it from 0 to 2 seconds in 0.05-second steps in **File > Settings > Radio**. If you find that the first fraction of a second of your transmission is missing at the receiving end, try increasing this value.

---

## 11. Audio Setup

### 11.1 Choosing Audio Devices

Open **File > Settings > Audio** to configure audio input and output devices.

**Input Device**: Select the audio device that receives audio from your radio. This is used for SSTV reception. If your radio is connected via a USB audio interface (such as a SignaLink, DigiRig, or a built-in USB codec on modern radios like the IC-7300), select that device. If you leave it on "System default," the app uses your operating system's default input device.

**Output Device**: Select the audio device that feeds audio to your radio. This is used for SSTV transmission. Select the same interface you use for digital modes. Leave it on "System default" to use the system's default output.

The device list is refreshed each time you open the Settings dialog, so hot-plugged USB devices will appear.

**Linux (PipeWire) note:** if you route TX audio through a virtual PipeWire sink — for example a "Radio" null-sink you've set up with `pactl`, `qpwgraph`, or `pavucontrol` to keep SSTV audio separate from your desktop sound — it appears in the Output Device list labelled **(PipeWire)**, alongside the regular sound-card entries. Selecting it moves Open-SSTV's transmit audio onto that sink specifically; every other application's audio stays wherever it already goes.

### 11.2 Sample Rate

Choose between **48,000 Hz** (48 kHz) and **44,100 Hz** (44.1 kHz). The default is 48 kHz, which is the standard for SSTV applications and matches the encoder's native sample rate. Most USB audio interfaces support both rates. Use 44.1 kHz only if your audio device does not support 48 kHz.

> **Note:** If you change the sample rate while a capture is running, the active PortAudio stream is still using the old rate. The app shows a status-bar notice asking you to stop and restart capture; until you do, the RX path's sample count will be wrong and any progress label will be slightly off. TX encoding uses the new rate on the next Transmit.

### 11.3 Input and Output Gain

Two sliders let you adjust software gain for input (receive) and output (transmit). The default is 100% (unity gain — no change). These are digital gain controls applied before decoding (input) and after encoding (output). They do not change your sound card's hardware volume.

The **RX input gain** slider ranges from 0–200%. Increase it if the received signal is too quiet for reliable decoding; decrease it if audio is clipping.

The **TX output gain** slider defaults to **0–100%**. Most USB-audio rigs (IC-7300, FT-991A, etc.) only need 10–15% for correct ALC. Enable **overdrive** (checkbox below the slider) to extend the ceiling to 200% if your setup needs more digital drive.

### 11.4 Audio Routing Tips

**Simplest setup (VOX)**: Connect your computer's audio output to your radio's microphone input and your radio's speaker/headphone output to your computer's audio input. Enable VOX on your radio. The app plays SSTV audio, VOX keys the radio, and you receive by recording the radio's audio output.

**USB audio interface**: A dedicated USB interface (SignaLink USB, DigiRig Mobile, or a radio with built-in USB audio like the IC-7300) provides cleaner audio and avoids RF feedback. Select the interface as both input and output device in the app's settings.

**Virtual audio cables (software loopback)**: On Linux you can use PulseAudio or PipeWire loopback modules. On macOS, tools like BlackHole or Soundflower can route audio between applications. On Windows, Virtual Audio Cable (VAC) serves the same purpose. This is useful if you are piping audio between Open-SSTV and another application such as SDR software.

## 12. Settings Reference

Open the settings dialog via **File > Settings** (or the menu shortcut). It has three tabs.

### 12.1 Audio Tab

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Input Device | Audio input for RX (list of detected devices, or "System default") | System default |
| Output Device | Audio output for TX (list of detected devices, or "System default") | System default |
| Sample Rate | 44100 Hz or 48000 Hz | 48000 Hz |
| Input Gain | Digital gain for received audio, 0–200% | 100% |
| Output Gain | Digital gain for transmitted audio, 0–100% (extend to 200% with overdrive) | 100% |
| Enable overdrive | Expands TX Output Gain ceiling from 100% to 200% | Off |
| Test Tone | Transmit a 700 Hz + 1900 Hz two-tone signal for 5 s (enabled whenever no transmission is already in flight — no rig connection required) | — |
| Weak-signal mode | Relaxes VIS leader detection (40% → 25%) and start-bit minimum (20 ms → 15 ms) | Off |
| Apply slant correction to final image | Re-decodes the completed image with a global least-squares timing correction. Helpful for clean signals with clock drift; can corrupt weak/marginal signals. | Off |
| Per-line incremental decode (all modes) | Decodes each scan line as its sync pulse arrives instead of reprocessing the full audio buffer on every flush. Default since v0.1.24. Uncheck to fall back to the legacy batch decoder. | On |

**TX gain calibration workflow:** Raise Output Gain → click Test Tone → watch your radio's ALC meter → adjust Output Gain up or down → repeat until ALC just barely flickers on peaks. The gain slider remains live while the tone is playing so you can tune without stopping. For typical IC-7300 / USB-audio setups, ~10–15% is the sweet spot. Test Tone doesn't require a rig connection — VOX/manual-PTT operators can use it too; watch the radio's own ALC meter and key it however you normally key transmissions (rigctld/serial PTT, or your radio's VOX detecting the tone).

> **Enable overdrive** only if ALC won't move at 100%. Most setups don't need it. When you tick the checkbox, the slider ceiling expands from 100% to 200%.

> **IC-7300 note:** The radio has its own audio input level control at **Menu → SET → Connectors → USB MOD Level**. The factory default (around 50%) is fine for most setups — you generally don't need to change it. Adjust the app's Output Gain slider and your computer's system output volume first; only touch USB MOD Level if you are recalibrating from scratch.

**Weak-signal RX mode:** Tick "Weak-signal mode" if you can hear an SSTV signal in the static but VIS decoding never triggers. This relaxes two internal detection thresholds (leader presence fraction 40% → 25%, minimum start-bit duration 20 ms → 15 ms) so faint or intermittently fading signals can lock on. The trade-off is slightly more false-positive VIS detections; these reset cleanly to IDLE and don't produce decode errors.

**Apply slant correction to final image:** After a complete image is received, the app normally uses the progressive decode result as-is. With this option enabled, a second single-pass decode runs over the full retained audio buffer and applies a global least-squares timing correction (slant correction) to compensate for slight clock-drift between the transmitting station's soundcard and yours. This can straighten images that arrive slightly skewed. However, on weak or noisy signals the correction algorithm has no outlier rejection — false-positive sync detections corrupt the timing fit and produce a result *worse* than the progressive image. Leave this off unless you are receiving strong, clean signals from a station with a known timing drift problem.

**Per-line incremental decode (all modes):** The default decoder since v0.1.24. Instead of reprocessing the full growing audio buffer on every flush (O(N²) CPU), this path decodes each scan line as soon as its sync pulse arrives — roughly 50× less CPU on long modes like Martin M1. All 22 supported modes are covered: Scottie, Martin, PD, Wraase SC2, Pasokon, and Robot 36. Robot 36 additionally benefits from linear (mean) chroma sampling and linear inter-row chroma upsampling, which produces softer, more accurate colour edges than the batch decoder's median + nearest-neighbour copy. The legacy batch decoder is still available as a fallback — uncheck this box if a decode looks wrong and file a bug with the saved audio.

### 12.2 Radio Tab

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Connection Mode | "Manual (no rig control)", "Direct Serial (built-in)", or "rigctld (Hamlib daemon)" | Manual |
| Serial Protocol | Icom CI-V, Kenwood, Yaesu, or PTT Only (DTR/RTS) | PTT Only (DTR/RTS) |
| Serial Port | Serial port path (editable dropdown listing detected ports) | (empty) |

![Radio settings tab](docs/screenshots/settings-radio.png)

### 12.3 Images Tab

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Default TX Mode | SSTV mode pre-selected in the Transmit panel mode dropdown | Martin M1 |
| Auto-save | Automatically save every decoded image to the save directory | Off |
| Save Directory | Folder for saved and auto-saved images (browse button to pick) | ~/Pictures/open_sstv |
| **TX Banner — Enable** | Stamp a header strip on every transmitted image | Off |
| **TX Banner — Background** | Banner background colour (click swatch to pick) | `#202020` |
| **TX Banner — Text** | Banner text colour (click swatch to pick) | `#FFFFFF` |
| **TX Banner — Size** | Named preset: Small (24 px / 18 pt), Medium (32 px / 24 pt), Large (40 px / 30 pt) | Small |
| **TX Banner — Preview (strip)** | Live preview of the banner strip with the current colour and size selections | — |
| **TX Banner — Preview on image…** | Opens a file picker and shows the banner composited onto the chosen photo (scaled to fit the screen) | — |

**TX Banner** stamps an identification strip across the top of every transmitted image (not the test tone). The strip shows your callsign flush-left and "Open-SSTV v{version}" flush-right. It is applied after all image-editor crops and text overlays, immediately before SSTV encoding — so the strip is always the outermost layer.

> **Note (v0.1.23+):** The source image is gently resized to fit *below* the banner strip so user content is never overwritten. Output dimensions match the SSTV mode's native size exactly — the banner occupies the top `banner_height` rows and the image content occupies the remaining rows. A 320 × 240 Robot 36 image with a 24 px banner becomes a 320 × 240 output consisting of a 24-row banner atop 216 rows of your resized image.

The live strip preview in Settings updates as you edit colours, callsign, or size — what you see is exactly what will be stamped on air. The "Preview on image…" button lets you see the banner composited against a real photo (scaled to 80 % of the screen if the image is huge) so you can check readability before committing to TX.

![Images settings tab](docs/screenshots/settings-images.png)

### 12.4 CW Station ID

Open-SSTV can automatically append a Morse code station identification to every SSTV transmission. This satisfies the FCC Part 97 (and equivalent ITU) requirement that every amateur radio transmission be identified by the station's callsign at least every ten minutes and at the end of each contact.

**Why CW?** Morse code is universally understood by ham radio equipment and operators worldwide, and it can be decoded even when voice audio would be unintelligible. A short CW tail adds only a few seconds to the end of a transmission and ensures legal identification without interrupting the image.

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Append CW ID after transmissions | Enable/disable automatic CW ID | On |
| Speed | Sending speed in words per minute (15–30 WPM) | 20 WPM |
| Tone | Sidetone frequency in Hz (400–1200 Hz, step 50) | 800 Hz |
| Callsign used | Read-only; shows the callsign from PTT / Identity above | — |

**How it works:** After the SSTV image audio completes, Open-SSTV inserts 500 ms of silence (to let receiver AGC settle), then plays the CW sidetone. PTT remains keyed throughout the entire SSTV + silence + CW sequence — there is no unkey between the image and the ID. The Stop button cancels at any point; the per-transmission TX watchdog (introduced in v0.1.28 and covered in Settings → Radio) covers the full SSTV + gap + CW duration.

**Test Tone is exempt** — the ALC calibration signal does not append a CW ID because it is not a communication transmission.

**If callsign is empty:** CW ID is skipped with a warning in the log. TX is not blocked — but you should set your callsign in PTT / Identity before going on the air.

**Unsupported characters:** The CW encoder supports A–Z, 0–9, `/`, and `-`. Any other character in the callsign field (spaces within a word, punctuation other than `/` and `-`, non-ASCII glyphs) is skipped and a WARNING log entry lists what was dropped. If you see this warning, double-check that your callsign matches the set the Morse encoder knows — a partial ID does not satisfy the regulatory requirement.

> **Regulatory note:** US Part 97.119 and equivalent ITU rules require identification at the end of each communication and at least every 10 minutes during a communication. Most SSTV modes fit comfortably under 10 minutes (Pasokon P7 at ~406 s = ~6.8 minutes is the longest Open-SSTV ships), so the end-of-transmission CW ID satisfies the requirement for a single SSTV QSO exchange. For very long modes or multi-image runs, consider sending a voice or additional CW ID between transmissions to re-start the 10-minute clock.

## 13. Templates In Depth (v0.3)

### 13.1 How Templates Work

A v0.3 template is a **stack of layers** — a base photo, banners, gradients, and text overlays — composited together at TX time. All positions and sizes are stored as percentages of the frame, so a single template renders cleanly at any SSTV mode's resolution (Robot 36's 320×240, PD-120's 640×496, PD-290's 800×616, and everything in between).

Text layers can contain **tokens** like `%c` or `{tocall}` that are filled in from your callsign, your QSO State, the rig frequency, and the clock when you press Transmit. The same template you use for "CQ CQ CQ DE W0AEZ" today will say "DE N7XYZ" tomorrow if you change your callsign in Settings — the template doesn't know or care.

Templates are stored as plain-text TOML files in your config directory (see [13.9](#139-toml-files--sharing-templates)), so you can hand-edit, version-control, or share them with other operators.

### 13.2 The Template Gallery

The gallery sits on the TX panel, above the QSO state widget. It shows a thumbnail grid of every template Open-SSTV can find, each rendered live with your current TX photo and QSO state.

**Filter** — The chips at the top (**All / CQ / Reply / 73 / Custom**) filter the grid by role. The role is set per-template in the editor and helps keep big libraries organised.

**Select** — Single-click a thumbnail to mark it as the active template for the next transmission. The selected card is highlighted with a coloured border.

**+ New…** — Opens a blank template in the editor.

**Right-click a thumbnail** — Context menu with:
- **Edit** — open in the editor (same as double-click).
- **Duplicate** — create a copy with `(copy)` appended to the name. Use this as your starting point for tweaks; it never mutates the source.
- **Rename** — change the displayed name (the on-disk filename updates as well).
- **Delete** — remove the template file. There is no undo, so make sure you have the TOML elsewhere if you want to keep a backup.

**Double-click** a thumbnail to open it in the editor.

On first launch, Open-SSTV installs a **starter pack** of templates (CQSSTV, CQ DE Call, Reply Exchange, Reply Simple, 73, plus vertical-orientation variants) into your user templates directory. They behave just like any user template — feel free to edit, rename, or delete them.

### 13.3 The Template Editor

Open the editor by double-clicking a thumbnail, right-clicking → **Edit**, or clicking **+ New…**. The dialog has three panels:

**Left — Layer list.** Every layer in the template, top to bottom (top-most layer renders on top). Each row has a **visibility checkbox** for quick previewing without deleting. Buttons below the list:
- **+ Photo / + Text / + Rect / + Gradient** — add a new layer of that type.
- **↑ / ↓** — reorder the selected layer.
- **Delete** — remove the selected layer.

**Center — Live preview.** Renders the template at the selected mode's aspect ratio with your current TX photo and a sample QSO state (`W0XYZ`, RST `595`, name `Alex`) so tokens show plausible text instead of empty placeholders. The preview re-renders 300 ms after the last property change, so dragging spin-boxes feels smooth instead of laggy.

**Right — Property inspector.** A scrollable form whose fields swap based on the selected layer's type. All layers share these properties:
- **Anchor** — which corner/edge of the layer's bounding box is pinned to the canvas: Top-Left, Top-Center, Top-Right, Center-Left, Center, Center-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Center, Bottom-Right, or **Fill (cover canvas)** which stretches the layer to the full frame.
- **Offset X / Offset Y (%)** — distance inwards from the anchor edge, in percent of frame width/height.
- **Width / Height (%)** — bounding box size. Optional for text (auto-sized from glyphs); required for rect/gradient.
- **Opacity** — 0.0 – 1.0.
- **Rotation (°)** — currently most useful for text and rect layers.

Type-specific properties are described in [13.4](#134-layer-types).

**Save** writes the template to disk and emits a refresh signal so the gallery picks it up immediately. **Save As…** prompts for a new filename — handy after Duplicate when you want to fork without overwriting. **Cancel** discards changes; the editor works on a deep copy of the template, so until you click Save the on-disk file is untouched.

The editor is **non-modal** — you can leave it open while operating, change your TX photo or QSO state in the main window, and watch the preview update accordingly.

### 13.4 Layer Types

**Photo** — The user-selected TX photo, composited as the base of the image. Set **Fit** to:
- **cover** — fills the canvas, cropping any overflow (default; what most callsign cards want).
- **contain** — fits the whole photo with letterboxing.
- **stretch** — distorts to fill exactly. Use sparingly.

**Text** — A line of text with full token support. Properties:
- **Text** — the raw template string (e.g. `CQ CQ CQ DE %c`, or `de {callsign}`). `\n` inserts a line break.
- **Font family** — see [13.7](#137-fonts).
- **Font size (%)** — height of one line as a percentage of frame height. Typical banner text is 5–8 %; large hero callsigns are 18–28 %.
- **Fill colour** — RGBA via the swatch button.
- **Stroke** — optional outline around glyphs (colour + width in pixels). Essential for white text over busy photos.
- **Shadow** — optional drop shadow (offset, colour, blur). Stack with stroke for maximum legibility.
- **Align** — left / center / right (only matters for multi-line text).
- **Slashed zero** — when on (default), ASCII `0` in callsign-valued tokens (`%c`, `%o`, `{callsign}`, `{tocall}`) is replaced with `Ø`, so W0AEZ renders as WØAEZ. Doesn't affect RST, dates, or other numeric fields.
- **Orientation** — `horizontal` (normal) or `stacked` (letter-over-letter, vertical). See [13.8](#138-text-features-stacking-auto-shrink-stroke-shadow).
- **Date / Time format** — strftime patterns for the `%d` / `%t` / `{date}` / `{time}` tokens in this layer (defaults `%Y-%m-%d` and `%H:%M`).

**Rect** — A solid or semi-transparent rectangle. Used for banner strips behind text (e.g. a 9-%-tall green bar across the top of a CQSSTV card). Only property beyond the shared geometry is **Fill** (RGBA).

**Gradient** — A two-stop linear gradient. Properties:
- **From colour / To colour** (RGBA — make one transparent for fade-to-clear effects).
- **Angle (°)** — `0` = left-to-right, `90` = top-to-bottom, `180` = right-to-left, `270` = bottom-to-top.

A common pattern: a Gradient layer pinned to **Fill** with `from = (0,0,0,180)` and `to = (0,0,0,0)` at 270° darkens the bottom of a photo so white text reads cleanly without fully obscuring the image.

**RX Image** — A slot that displays the most-recently-pinned received image, cropped/scaled by the same **Fit** modes as Photo. Use it on **Reply** templates to show "the picture I just received from you" alongside your reply. Properties are the shared anchor/size/fit set; no fill or stroke. When no RX image has been pinned yet, the editor preview shows a white-bordered placeholder box with an "RX" label so you can see where the slot will land — at TX time the same slot renders as the actual received picture (no border). See [13.10](#1310-rx-to-tx-image-workflow) for the full pin-and-reply flow.

**Pattern** — A repeating geometric tile (checkered, diagonal stripes, or dots) tinted with an RGBA colour. Useful as a subtle decorative band — for example, a 6-%-tall diagonal-stripes pattern under a gradient for a contest-style banner. Properties:
- **Pattern ID** — `checkered`, `diagonal_stripes`, or `dots`.
- **Tint** (RGBA) — multiplied with the pattern's white/transparent tile, so a tint of `(255, 0, 0, 200)` produces semi-transparent red shapes on a transparent background.
- **Cell size (%)** — pattern unit size as a percentage of frame width. Defaults to `2.0`. Smaller values produce a finer texture; larger values give bold geometric blocks.

**Station Image** — A static image file from your local **assets** directory (next to your templates dir, see [13.9](#139-toml-files--sharing-templates)). Use it for QSL-card backgrounds, club logos, hand-lettered "73" graphics, or any custom artwork you want available across multiple templates. Set the `path` to a name like `qsl_card.png` or `logos/club.svg`; Open-SSTV resolves it relative to `{user_config_dir}/open_sstv/assets/`. **Absolute paths and `..` segments are refused at load time** (templates can't reach outside the assets dir even if hand-edited maliciously). The same **Fit** modes as Photo apply.

### 13.5 Token Reference

Tokens are placeholders in text layers that resolve to live values at TX time. Two equivalent forms are accepted everywhere; pick whichever reads better. The single-letter `%` form matches MMSSTV muscle memory; the `{name}` form is more readable.

| `%` form | `{name}` form | Resolves to |
|---|---|---|
| `%c` | `{callsign}` | Your callsign (from Settings, uppercased; slashed-zero applied if enabled) |
| `%o` | `{tocall}` | Other station's callsign (from QSO State) |
| `%r` | `{rst}` | Signal report (from QSO State) |
| `%name_o` | `{tocallname}` | Other op's name (from QSO State) |
| `%note` | `{note}` | Free-form QSO note (from QSO State) |
| `%n` | `{name}` | Your name (from Settings) |
| `%g` | `{grid}` | Your grid square (from Settings) |
| `%m` | `{mode}` | Current SSTV mode display name (e.g. "Scottie S1") |
| `%d` | `{date}` | UTC date (default `%Y-%m-%d`; per-layer override available) |
| `%t` | `{time}` | UTC time (default `%H:%M`; per-layer override available) |
| `%f` | `{freq}` | Rig frequency, e.g. `14.2300 MHz` (blank if no rig connected) |
| `%b` | `{band}` | Ham band, e.g. `20m`, `40m`, `2m` (blank if no rig connected) |
| `%q` | `{qso_serial}` | QSO serial number |
| `%v` | `{version}` | Open-SSTV version |
| `%%` | — | Literal `%` |

Unknown tokens **pass through unchanged** rather than erroring, so a template authored in a future version that introduces new tokens still loads cleanly in older builds — you'll just see the literal `%x` until you upgrade.

A copy of this cheat sheet is built into the template editor — click the **Tokens** help button to view it without leaving the dialog.

### 13.6 QSO State Widget

The QSO State widget lives on the TX panel between the gallery and the mode/transmit row. It feeds the dynamic tokens:

- **ToCall** — the callsign of the station you're working. Feeds `%o` / `{tocall}`. Uppercased automatically.
- **RST** — signal report. Feeds `%r` / `{rst}`. The dropdown is editable, with common values (`595`, `599`, `559`, `333`, etc.) pre-populated; defaults to `595`.
- **Name** — the other op's name (optional). Feeds `%name_o` / `{tocallname}`.

Any change in these fields triggers a re-render of the gallery thumbnails and the editor preview, so what you see is exactly what will go on the air. The widget detects when ToCall changes to a different callsign and treats that as a new QSO (clearing some session-scoped state under the hood; the Name and RST you typed remain as starting values for the next contact).

### 13.7 Fonts

Open-SSTV ships with **three fonts**:

- **DejaVu Sans Bold** — the default. Clean, very readable at small sizes, excellent Unicode coverage including the slashed `Ø`. Use for banner callsigns, info lines, signal reports.
- **Inter Bold** — modern, slightly narrower than DejaVu. Looks good in big hero text.
- **Press Start 2P** — pixelated retro arcade style. Great for novelty cards and "QRP / 5 W" stickers; not recommended for long lines because every glyph is the same width.

A template's **Font family** field accepts the display name (`"DejaVu Sans Bold"`, `"Inter Bold"`, `"Press Start 2P"`) and is matched fuzzily — case and spacing differences are ignored, so `dejavusansbold` works the same as `DejaVu Sans Bold`.

You can add more fonts: drop `.ttf` or `.otf` files into `{user_config_dir}/open_sstv/fonts/` (the same parent directory that holds `templates/`) and they appear in the editor's font dropdown on the next launch. The display name is the filename stem with hyphens/underscores converted to spaces.

If a template references a font that isn't installed, the renderer falls back to DejaVu Sans Bold and logs a warning — your template still renders, just in the fallback face.

### 13.8 Text Features: Stacking, Auto-Shrink, Stroke, Shadow

**Stacked vertical text** — Set a text layer's **Orientation** to `Stacked` and each character renders one above the next, no rotation. Pair with a **Center-Right** or **Center-Left** anchor and a tall, thin bounding box for classic vertical-callsign banners running down the side of a photo. Each character keeps its full glyph width, so descenders on letters like `g` or `y` are not clipped.

**Auto-shrink for overflow** — If a horizontal text layer's resolved string is too wide for its bounding box (or the configured font size), the renderer auto-shrinks the font down until it fits, rather than spilling off the canvas. It also wraps at word boundaries before shrinking, so `CQ CQ CQ DE W0AEZ` will go to two lines before it gets aggressively shrunk. This makes templates resilient to long contest exchanges and unusually long callsigns without manual fiddling.

**Stroke** — An outlined ring around every glyph at the configured pixel width and colour. White text with a black 4-pixel stroke is unbeatable for legibility over photographs.

**Shadow** — A blurred drop shadow at a configurable offset and colour. Stack with stroke for maximum punch on busy backgrounds; use shadow alone for a softer look.

### 13.9 TOML Files & Sharing Templates

Templates live in:

- **macOS** — `~/Library/Application Support/open_sstv/templates/`
- **Linux** — `~/.config/open_sstv/templates/`
- **Windows** — `%APPDATA%\open_sstv\templates\`

Each template is a single `.toml` file with one `[template]` table (name, role, reference frame, description) and a sequence of `[[layer]]` tables. They're plain text and easy to read, edit, version-control, or post on a forum. Sharing a template is just sharing the `.toml` file — drop it into another operator's templates directory and it appears in their gallery on next launch.

A minimal example:

```toml
[template]
name = "CQ DE"
role = "cq"
reference_frame = [320, 256]
schema_version = 1
description = "Simple CQ card."

[[layer]]
type = "photo"
id = "base_photo"
anchor = "FILL"
fit = "cover"

[[layer]]
type = "text"
id = "cq_text"
text = "CQ CQ CQ DE %c"
anchor = "BC"
offset_y_pct = 5.0
font_family = "DejaVu Sans Bold"
font_size_pct = 7.0
fill = [255, 255, 255, 255]
stroke = { color = [0, 0, 0, 255], width_px = 3 }
slashed_zero = true
```

The `schema_version` field is `1` for all v0.3 templates. Future major template-format changes will bump it; older builds will refuse to load a higher schema version rather than misinterpreting it.

### 13.10 RX-to-TX Image Workflow

A common QSO move: you receive a picture, then you want to reply with a card that shows their picture next to your callsign. v0.3 makes this one click.

1. **Decode and pin.** When an image lands in the **RX history gallery** (bottom strip of the Receive panel), single-click the thumbnail. Two things happen at once:
   - The Receive panel's main preview swaps to that image so you can see it at full size without having to save it.
   - The same image is *pinned* into the TX side as the active **RX image**.
2. **Pick a Reply template.** Switch to the TX panel and choose any template containing an `rx_image` layer (the bundled **Reply Exchange** template is the canonical example — its slot sits in the bottom-right corner). Every template thumbnail re-renders with the pinned image filling its `rx_image` slot, so you can see exactly which template will look best with their picture.
3. **Type their callsign / RST.** Use the QSO State widget — the dynamic tokens (`%o`, `%r`, `%name_o`) update both the editor preview and the gallery thumbnails in real time.
4. **Transmit.** The composited image — your photo, their picture in the slot, your callsign and theirs as text — is encoded directly. No save-and-reopen, no manual cropping, no separate "burn-in" step.

**Clearing.** If you want to send a Reply template *without* an RX image (the slot then renders as the editor's white-bordered placeholder), there's no separate "clear" button — pin a different decoded image, restart the app, or pick a non-Reply template.

**Right-click on a gallery thumbnail** still offers the older actions: **View** (same as single-click), **Save As…**, and **Copy to Clipboard** — useful when you want to save a card you decoded but not pin it for reply.

---

## 14. Image Editor Reference

The image editor (opened by clicking **Edit Image** on the Transmit panel) provides these tools:

**Crop**: Drag the yellow crop rectangle or enter coordinates manually. "Auto-fit Crop" computes the largest centered rectangle matching the target mode's aspect ratio. "Lock Aspect Ratio" constrains manual adjustments. "Apply Crop" commits the crop; "Reset" reverts to the original image.

**Rotate**: Rotate the image 90 degrees counterclockwise or clockwise.

**Flip**: Mirror the image horizontally or vertically.

**Text Overlays**: Add text at any of 7 named positions (Top Left/Center/Right, Center, Bottom Left/Center/Right) plus a **Custom** mode where X and Y spin boxes let you place text at any pixel position (5-pixel step). The named presets auto-fill the X/Y spin boxes; manual edits to the spin boxes switch the Position dropdown to Custom automatically. Font size is configurable (8–120 px) with a colour picker. Multiple overlays can be stacked. Text is rendered with a dark shadow outline for readability. The overlay list shows each entry as `"text" SIZE @ POSITION` (or `"text" SIZE @ (x,y)` for Custom positions).

The info label shows: current image dimensions, target dimensions for the selected mode, and the number of text layers.

When you click OK, all overlays are composited onto the image, and the result is resized to the SSTV mode's native resolution using high-quality LANCZOS resampling. A separate "clean" copy of the image without text overlays is also retained so the Transmit panel's **Clear Text** button can revert to the base image without losing your crop, rotation, or flip.

---

## 15. Command-Line Interface

Open-SSTV includes two CLI tools that work without a graphical display. They are useful for scripting, Raspberry Pi deployments, and testing.

### 15.1 open-sstv-encode

Encode an image into an SSTV WAV file.

```
open-sstv-encode IMAGE -o OUTPUT.wav --mode MODE [--sample-rate RATE]
```

**Arguments**:

- `IMAGE` — Path to the input image (any format Pillow can read: PNG, JPEG, BMP, TIFF, WebP, etc.)
- `-o, --output` — Path to the output WAV file (required)
- `--mode` — SSTV mode (required). One of: `robot_36`, `martin_m1`, `martin_m2`, `martin_m3`, `martin_m4`, `scottie_s1`, `scottie_s2`, `scottie_dx`, `scottie_s3`, `scottie_s4`, `pd_50`, `pd_90`, `pd_120`, `pd_160`, `pd_180`, `pd_240`, `pd_290`, `wraase_sc2_120`, `wraase_sc2_180`, `pasokon_p3`, `pasokon_p5`, `pasokon_p7`.
- `--sample-rate` — Output sample rate in Hz (default: 48000, or pass `44100` for CD-rate WAVs)

**Example**:

```bash
open-sstv-encode my_photo.jpg --mode robot_36 -o output.wav
```

The output is a mono 16-bit PCM WAV file ready to be played through a sound card or piped to your radio.

### 15.2 open-sstv-decode

Decode an SSTV WAV file into an image.

```
open-sstv-decode INPUT.wav -o OUTPUT.png [--quiet]
```

**Arguments**:

- `INPUT.wav` — Path to the input WAV file (16-bit PCM recommended; stereo is supported and mixed to mono)
- `-o, --output` — Path to the output image file (format inferred from extension: PNG, JPEG, BMP, etc.) (required)
- `-q, --quiet` — Suppress the success message

**Example**:

```bash
open-sstv-decode recording.wav -o decoded_image.png
```

The decoder auto-detects the SSTV mode from the VIS header. If no valid VIS header is found, it exits with code 1 and prints an error to stderr.

> **Note:** `open-sstv-decode` uses the batch decoder (median + PIL colour pipeline for Robot 36). The GUI uses the newer incremental decoder with slowrx-style integer YCbCr → RGB matrix, so Robot 36 colours may differ slightly between `open-sstv-decode` output and the GUI's live decode. Other modes produce bit-identical results across both paths.

---

## 16. Configuration Files

Open-SSTV stores its configuration in platform-appropriate directories using the XDG Base Directory Specification on Linux and equivalent paths on macOS and Windows.

**Settings file**: `~/.config/open_sstv/config.toml` (Linux). Contains all settings from the Settings dialog in TOML format. You can edit this file manually if desired, but it is easier to use the GUI.

**Templates file**: `~/.config/open_sstv/templates.toml`. Contains your QSO template definitions. Manually editing this file is supported but the template editor is recommended.

On macOS, these files are typically at `~/Library/Application Support/open_sstv/`. On Windows, they are at `%APPDATA%\open_sstv\`.

If either file is missing or empty, the app creates it with default values on first launch.

---

## 17. Troubleshooting

**No audio input / "Listening..." but nothing happens**

- Confirm the correct input device is selected in Settings > Audio.
- Check that your radio is feeding audio to the computer. Play a local SSTV WAV file through your speakers and point your microphone at them as a basic test.
- Make sure the sample rate in Settings matches your audio device's capability (try 48 kHz first, then 44.1 kHz).
- Increase the input gain slider if the audio level is very low.
- On Linux, verify that PulseAudio or PipeWire is routing the correct source. Use `pavucontrol` to check.

**Decode starts but the image is garbled, slanted, or has wrong colors**

- A moderate slant is normal and should be corrected automatically. Severe slant may indicate a very large sample rate mismatch between your sound card and the transmitting station.
- Garbled images can result from interference, weak signals, or multipath. Try again with a stronger signal.
- Wrong colors may indicate a mode mismatch. The app auto-detects mode via the VIS header, but if the VIS was corrupted by noise, the wrong decoder may be applied. Try decoding from a saved WAV file using `open-sstv-decode`.
- If you are receiving from a station using an unusual Robot 36 variant, the app auto-detects between the two common Robot 36 layouts (PySSTV single-line and canonical broadcast line-pair).

**I deleted a default template and want it back**

- **Settings → General → Restore Default Templates** re-installs any of the
  eight bundled starters that are missing. Your own templates, and any edits
  you've made to a starter, are never overwritten — only genuinely missing
  files are restored.
- Deleting a starter is permanent from v0.6.5 onward. Before that they came
  back by themselves on the next launch if you removed all eight.

**macOS: capture starts but decodes nothing — the waterfall stays black**

- Almost always microphone permission. macOS gates **every** audio input
  behind privacy control, *including virtual loopback devices like
  BlackHole and Loopback* that never touch a real microphone — and a
  blocked app still opens its input stream successfully and simply receives
  silence, so the app looks like it's capturing.
- Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone** and enable
  Open-SSTV, then start capture again. From v0.6.3 the app detects this and
  says so instead of pretending to capture.
- If Open-SSTV isn't listed there at all, launch it and click **Start
  Capture** once — that's what triggers the system prompt.

**A transmission stalls partway, or the app hangs for a couple of seconds when quitting (Windows)**

- Both point at the audio device rather than the radio. On Windows, prefer a
  **WASAPI** output device over the same device's **MME** entry in
  Settings → Audio. MME is the legacy Windows audio backend, and it is where
  transmissions have been seen to stop draining mid-image and where app
  shutdown blocks long enough to log *"audio worker stop() did not complete
  in 2 s"*.
- Your rig is **not** left keyed by this: PTT is dropped independently of the
  audio path. If a transmission does stall, the log records it explicitly —
  look for *"TX audio write stalled"* or *"TX audio appears WEDGED"*.
- If it happens on WASAPI too, please file an issue with an exported
  diagnostics bundle (Settings → Diagnostics → *Export Diagnostics…*) — the
  log now names the device, host API, and which call blocked.

**Rig not connecting (rigctld)**

- Make sure `rigctld` is running. If you are not using auto-launch, start it manually: `rigctld -m MODEL -r /dev/ttyUSB0 -s 19200 &`
- Check that the host and port in Settings match where rigctld is listening (default: localhost:4532).
- Use the "Test rigctld Connection" button in Settings to diagnose. The error message will indicate whether it is a connection refused (daemon not running), timeout (wrong host/port), or command error (wrong model or baud rate).
- On Linux, make sure your user has permission to access the serial port: `sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER` (then log out and back in).

**Rig not connecting (direct serial)**

- Verify the serial port, baud rate, and protocol match your radio's settings.
- For Icom radios, ensure the CI-V address matches your radio's configuration (check your radio's menu settings for CI-V address). The most common address for the IC-7300 is 0x94.
- Some radios require you to enable the serial port or USB connection in their menu settings.
- On macOS, use `/dev/cu.*` ports, not `/dev/tty.*`.
- Use the "Test Serial Connection" button to diagnose.

**PTT not keying the radio**

- In Manual mode, the app does not control PTT. Use VOX on your radio or key it manually.
- With rig control, verify the connection is active (green "Connected" indicator on the toolbar).
- If using PTT-only serial mode, make sure you selected the correct PTT line (DTR or RTS) to match your cable wiring.
- Try increasing the PTT delay in Settings if the radio is keying but the beginning of the transmission is clipped (the relay may not have engaged yet when audio starts).
- Some radios require a specific setting to allow CAT-controlled PTT. Check your radio's menu.

**No audio output during transmit**

- Confirm the correct output device is selected in Settings > Audio.
- Increase the output gain if the level is very low.
- If using a USB audio interface, make sure it is selected as the output device — not your computer's built-in speakers.
- On macOS, check System Settings > Sound to ensure the correct output device is active.
- On Linux with PipeWire, if you route audio to your radio through a virtual sink, select that named sink (labelled "(PipeWire)") rather than "System default" — see [11.1 Choosing Audio Devices](#111-choosing-audio-devices). If transmission audio doesn't reach the sink, confirm `pactl` is installed (part of any standard PipeWire desktop) and check the log for a "routed" or "no new sink-input appeared" message.

**ALC doesn't move during Test Tone or transmission**

- Raise the Output Gain slider in **Settings → Audio**. The default ceiling is 0–100%; for typical USB-audio rigs (IC-7300, FT-991A, etc.) the sweet spot is around 10–15%. If 100% still isn't enough, tick **Enable overdrive** to extend the ceiling to 200%.
- Check the **macOS system output volume for the USB audio device**. macOS stores a per-device volume that can default below 100% and is separate from the master volume. Go to **System Settings → Sound → Output**, select your USB audio interface, and set the volume to 100%.
- Make sure the correct output device is selected in Settings → Audio. If "System default" is chosen but your radio interface is not the macOS default, the audio goes to the wrong device.
- For reference, the IC-7300's radio-side input level is at **Menu → SET → Connectors → USB MOD Level**. The factory default (~50%) works for most setups and you shouldn't need to change it if the steps above resolve the issue.

**Signal audible but VIS never triggers (no decode starts)**

- Tick **Weak-signal mode** in **Settings → Audio → Receive**. This relaxes the VIS leader detection threshold from 40% to 25% and the start-bit minimum from 20 ms to 15 ms — useful for marginal QSOs, strong multipath, or acoustic coupling through a speaker. The trade-off is occasional false-positive VIS detections that reset cleanly.
- Confirm your audio input device and input gain are set correctly (audio levels are visible in the OS sound meter).
- Make sure the signal is in the SSTV audio passband: SSTV uses roughly 1100–2300 Hz. If the radio is in LSB, the signal may be inverted — try USB instead.

**Application crashes or freezes**

- File a bug report at [github.com/bucknova/Open-SSTV/issues](https://github.com/bucknova/Open-SSTV/issues) with your operating system, Python version, and the error traceback from the terminal.
- Try running from a terminal (`open-sstv`) to see error messages that may not appear in the GUI.
- Ensure you are running Python 3.11 or later and that all dependencies are up to date: `pip install -e . --upgrade`.

**Image saves as black or incomplete**

- This can happen if you save before decoding is complete. Wait until the status shows "Decode complete" before saving.
- If auto-save is on, the app saves immediately on decode completion, so partial images should not occur.

## 18. The Logbook (v0.4)

Open-SSTV v0.4 adds a built-in QSO logbook so every contact you make
or hear can be captured with its image and exchanged with the wider
logging ecosystem as ADIF.  This section is the short tour — the full
operator guide, including ADIF interop notes for HRD, N1MM+, LoTW,
eQSL, Club Log, and QRZ.com, lives in
[docs/logbook.md](docs/logbook.md).

### 18.1 Capturing contacts

After a transmission or reception completes, a **Log QSO** dialog
opens pre-filled with everything the app already knows: mode, UTC
time, the rig's dial frequency (when connected), and the image.  TX
entries also pre-fill from the QSO bar's ToCall / RST / Name / Note
fields.  Type the callsign and reports, **Save** — or press **Esc**
and nothing is written.

SSTV calling frequencies are party lines, and most of what a
monitoring station decodes is *other people's* exchanges.  **Settings
→ General → Logbook → RX capture** chooses when receptions prompt:
after every decode (default), only while you're in a QSO (ToCall
filled in), or never.  Whatever you pick, any decoded image can be
logged deliberately later: right-click it in the RX gallery and
choose **Log QSO…**.  A separate **Log QSOs silently** option saves
draft entries with no dialog at all.

### 18.2 The Logbook window

**Tools → Logbook…** (Ctrl+L / Cmd+L) — or the **[Logbook…]** button
on the QSO bar — opens the log in its own window: a newest-first
table with callsign / mode / direction / date-range filters, an image
preview with the full contact details, editing via the same form the
capture flow uses, and manual entry with *Save & New* for keying in
paper logs.  Deleting an entry never touches the image files on disk.

### 18.3 ADIF import and export

**Export ADIF…** writes the currently filtered rows to a ``.adi``
file with your station identity (Settings → General) stamped into
every record.  **Import ADIF…** reads files from other loggers and
skips duplicates using the (callsign, time, mode) identity, so
re-importing your own export is a no-op.  The logbook database itself
is a single SQLite file in the platform data directory — back it up
like any file.  It is excluded from diagnostics zips unless you
explicitly opt in.

### 18.4 External Log (UDP, v0.6.7)

The **[External Log]** button on the TX panel's QSO bar, next to
**[Logbook…]**, broadcasts the current QSO over UDP so a companion
logging program (QLog, JTAlert, GridTracker, Log4OM, N1MM…) can pick
it up automatically — the same convention WSJT-X uses. It's a
deliberately separate, manual action: an SSTV QSO is usually several
images, and this sends exactly *one* record for the whole contact
when you click it, whatever is currently in the ToCall / RSTs / RSTr
/ Name / QTH / Grid / Note fields, with the click's UTC time, mode
fixed to `SSTV`, and frequency read from the Radio panel's **Freq:**
field. It never touches the local logbook database — sending has no
effect on your logged rows, and vice versa.

**Settings → Logging → UDP QSO log** sets the destination host/port
(default `127.0.0.1:2237`, WSJT-X's own default) and the wire format:
the framed **WSJT-X protocol** (default; what QLog/JTAlert/GridTracker/
N1MM expect) or **Raw ADIF** (Log4OM-style, unframed). See
[docs/logbook.md](docs/logbook.md) for the full details.

## 19. The Gallery (v0.5)

Open-SSTV v0.5 adds a built-in image browser for the pictures you've
received (and, with TX auto-save on, transmitted).  This is the short
tour — the full guide is [docs/gallery.md](docs/gallery.md).

### 19.1 Opening it

**Tools → Gallery…** (Ctrl+G / Cmd+G) opens the gallery in its own
window, alongside the Logbook.  The two are companion views of the
same data: the Logbook is the table of contacts, the Gallery is the
wall of pictures.

### 19.2 What you see

Every image in your save directory appears as a thumbnail.  The
gallery joins those files to your logbook, so an image linked to a
logged contact shows that contact's callsign, mode, frequency, and
time in the detail panel — and a **→ QSO** button that jumps to the
row in the Logbook.  Images you received but never logged still
appear, with their date and mode read from the filename.

Filter by callsign, mode, or date range (as in the Logbook), and
sort / group by date, callsign, or mode.  Dates are UTC throughout.

### 19.3 What you can do

Select a thumbnail, then **Re-send to TX** (loads it into the TX
panel to transmit again), **Export…** (save a copy elsewhere; the
original stays put), or **Delete** (removes the file — a linked
logbook contact is kept, only its image link is cleared).  From the
Logbook, a contact with a saved image gets a **Show in Gallery**
button for the return trip.

Thumbnails are cached on disk, so reopening the gallery is instant;
editing an image regenerates its thumbnail automatically.

## 20. Remote Station (v0.6)

Open-SSTV v0.6 can serve a small web page from the machine running the
app, so a phone or laptop on the same network can watch receptions live,
browse the gallery and logbook, and — with a separate opt-in — compose
and transmit.  This is the short tour; the full guide is
[docs/remote.md](docs/remote.md).

Everything below is **off by default**.

### 20.1 Turning it on

**Settings → Remote → Enable the remote gallery server.**  Set **Host** to
`0.0.0.0` if you want to reach it from another device (the default,
`127.0.0.1`, serves only the machine itself), pick a **Port** (default
`8730`), and note the **access token** — it's required on every request.

The Remote tab shows the resulting URL and a **QR code**; scanning it with
your phone carries the token along automatically.  While the server is
running the main window shows a persistent "Remote on" indicator.

> Use this only on a network you trust.  The token keeps out casual
> visitors, but the connection is plain HTTP — don't expose the port to
> the internet.

### 20.2 What the browser gives you

- **Gallery** — received images, newest first.
- **Live** — the current decode painting in line by line.
- **Logbook** — your contacts, read-only.
- **Compose** — shoot or upload a photo, frame it (drag to move, pinch or
  slide to zoom), pick a template and mode, and transmit.  The crop box
  matches the chosen mode's frame shape, so what you frame is what goes
  out — narrow modes like Scottie S2 included.

The desktop renders the transmitted image, not the phone: your browser
sends the photo plus the text fields, and the station composites the
exact bytes it sends.

### 20.3 Transmitting safely

Remote transmit is a **second switch** (Settings → Remote → Remote
transmit), off by default even when the server is on, and it requires a
**connected CAT rig** — it is refused on the manual/VOX backend, where PTT
isn't actually commanded.

Every remote transmission is wrapped in:

- **a single-operator lease** — one browser at a time, and the desktop can
  always take control back;
- **a per-transmission confirmation** that expires in 30 seconds;
- **a dead-man's-switch** — if the browser stops sending its heartbeat
  (tab closed, Wi-Fi dropped, battery dead) the station **unkeys the rig
  automatically**;
- **a full-screen ON AIR takeover** with progress, elapsed/remaining time
  and an Abort button.

> Keep the page open and the screen awake while transmitting.  A phone
> that locks mid-transmission can stop the heartbeat, and the station will
> unkey — that's the safety net working, but it cuts the picture off
> partway.  Enabling your rig's own TX time-out timer is worthwhile as an
> independent backstop.

## 21. Glossary

**CAT (Computer Aided Transceiver)**: A protocol for controlling a radio from a computer, typically over a serial or USB connection. Allows reading and setting frequency, mode, and PTT state.

**CI-V**: Icom's proprietary CAT protocol, used on most Icom amateur radios. Communicates over a serial bus with addressable devices.

**CQ**: A general call inviting any station to respond. "CQ CQ CQ DE W1ABC" means "Calling any station, this is W1ABC."

**DE**: French for "from." Used in amateur radio to separate the called station's callsign from the calling station's. "W2XYZ DE W1ABC" means "W2XYZ, this is W1ABC."

**Hamlib**: An open-source library providing a standardized API for controlling amateur radios. The `rigctld` daemon provides a network interface to Hamlib.

**K**: An invitation for the other station to transmit. Used at the end of a transmission when you expect a reply.

**PTT (Press-to-Talk)**: The mechanism that switches a radio between receive and transmit. Can be a physical button, a foot switch, VOX, or CAT-controlled.

**QSO**: An amateur radio contact between two or more stations.

**rigctld**: The Hamlib rig control daemon. Runs as a background process and accepts commands over TCP, providing rig control to client applications.

**RST**: A signal report code. In SSTV, typically just the "RS" portion is used — Readability (1–5) and Strength (1–9). "59" means "perfectly readable, extremely strong signal."

**SK**: "End of contact." Signals that the QSO is finished.

**S-meter**: A signal strength meter on a radio receiver, calibrated in S-units (S0 to S9, then S9+10dB, S9+20dB, etc.). S9 corresponds to approximately -73 dBm on HF.

**SSTV (Slow-Scan Television)**: A method of sending still images over radio as audio tones. Each pixel is encoded as a frequency between 1500 Hz (black) and 2300 Hz (white).

**USB/LSB (Upper/Lower Sideband)**: Single-sideband modulation modes. SSTV on HF is typically transmitted on USB above 10 MHz and LSB below 10 MHz.

**VIS (Vertical Interval Signaling)**: An 8-bit header sent at the beginning of every SSTV transmission that identifies the SSTV mode. It consists of leader tones, a start bit, 7 data bits, a parity bit, and a stop bit.

**VOX (Voice-Operated Exchange)**: A circuit that automatically keys the transmitter when audio is present and unkeys when audio stops. Eliminates the need for a PTT switch.

**73**: Amateur radio shorthand for "best regards." Used as a closing salutation at the end of a QSO.
